Numerous tool libraries, local package management, mock environments, and more are built on Node.js, making it truly the infrastructure of the frontend world.The flourishing ecosystem has made it essential for everyone to install Node.js when building frontend projects. However, with the long history of products, versioning becomes a common issue\u2014some projects require new versions, while others need older ones. Managing multiple versions of Node.js has been a persistent challenge for developers.Currently, the open-source tool nvm addresses this issue. With simple command-line usage, developers can quickly switch between different versions of Node.js, allowing them to focus on development rather than wasting time on environment configuration.The predominant machines for frontend development are still Macbooks. Therefore, this article will explain how to elegantly install and use nvm on Mac to efficiently manage Node.js versions.',permalink:"/illa-website/ja/blog/nvm-use-2024",formattedDate:"2024\u5e741\u67083\u65e5",authors:[{name:"Owen Chen",title:"CEO",url:"https://github.com/smallSohoSolo",imageURL:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7929686?v=4",key:"owen"}],readingTime:4.035,date:"2024-01-03T06:08:44.000Z"},{title:"2024 has arrived, should I choose MUI?",description:"Every company has its own exclusive online business, and as the business continues to update and iterate, the complexity of the business will continuously increase over time.After the business complexity reaches a high level, internal teams need to view various data to make decisions for future strategies.
