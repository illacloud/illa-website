        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Owen, a full-stack engineer with previous experience at TikTok. My role there involved developing the platform, known for its engaging short video content, and ensuring a delightful user experience.</p>
<p>Despite my background as a Backend Engineer, I frequently found myself immersed in creating numerous data dashboards and admin panels to cater to my colleagues' diverse needs. From showcasing multifaceted business data to visualizing CI/CD tasks and crafting a special Admin Panel for a Christmas event, I managed to accomplish all these in just 14 days.</p>
<p>This barrage of disparate UI-related tasks presented significant challenges in my daily workflow. Ultimately, this led to my resignation. But, this experience inspired me to devote myself entirely to a new venture: assisting server engineers of various programming backgrounds to efficiently build the tools I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Check out the project:</p>
<ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every company has its own exclusive online business, and as the business continues to update and iterate, the complexity of the business will continuously increase over time.</p>
<p>After the business complexity reaches a high level, internal teams need to view various data to make decisions for future strategies. Therefore, we need a flexible tool to create personalized data dashboards to meet the diverse customization needs of internal team members, especially the boss, and help the team iterate quickly.</p>
<p>Using efficient tools to leave work early every day.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="some-issues-in-the-construction">Some issues in the construction<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/build-dashboard#some-issues-in-the-construction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Some issues in the construction „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Some issues in the construction „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The business of each company is distributed across different systems, and there are some connections between these systems. Some data needs to be queried using databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgresql</li>
<li>Mysql</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Some data comes from different types of microservices, possibly obtained from a specific API:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Detail API</li>
<li>Product Detail API</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The most challenging thing is that some data requires merging and secondary processing of both database and API data.</p>
<p>These issues make it very troublesome to build a personalized data dashboard. If starting development from scratch, we need to adapt to different data sources, leading to a steep increase in engineering costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need a flexible tool for displaying data dashboards, as "development" is not the most important; "display" is.</p>
<p>This tool needs some objective advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich charts to display data from different dimensions.</li>
<li>Support for various mainstream data sources.</li>
<li>Simple installation and usage.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the dynamic landscape of frequent holidays and special occasions, creating distinct online experiences becomes imperative. Each company may have its unique marketing days, requiring engaging activities. Crafting these online marketing campaigns inevitably poses a development challenge, necessitating substantial resource allocation. While the need for visually captivating designs is evident, the overall complexity may not justify significant development costs, especially when the lifecycle is limited to 1-2 weeks. In such cases, opting for low-code tools emerges as a financially prudent decision. Here, we advocate for a specific low-code solution.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="addressing-user-facing-components-webflow">Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#addressing-user-facing-components-webflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h3>

<p>The synergy of these two tools expedites the creation of business requirements in marketing scenarios. This synergistic approach minimizes the need for extensive development resources while addressing the demand for quick response and deployment. Consequently, it propels the business iteration speed to new heights.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="when-initiating-a-novel-business-venture">When Initiating a Novel Business Venture<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#when-initiating-a-novel-business-venture" class="hash-link" aria-label="When Initiating a Novel Business Venture „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="When Initiating a Novel Business Venture „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The commencement of a project necessitates a thorough evaluation of its characteristics. For comprehensive toC products such as social platforms, gaming applications, or IM services, the recommendation leans towards traditional development methodologies. This ensures a high degree of flexibility in adapting to evolving requirements.</p>
<p>For ventures centered around retail or services, the utilization of Shopify for frontend presentation proves advantageous. This choice guarantees widespread distribution of products while curbing development costs. Furthermore, Shopify supports customization, catering to diverse business needs effectively.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional/shopify.png" alt="shopify" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>In instances where a swift development of an app or website is paramount, direct coding may offer a faster solution. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate solution heavily relies on the unique attributes of the scenario.</p>
<p>If the backend functionality of Shopify falls short of requirements, the integration of ILLA Cloud can bridge the gap, providing a platform for customized management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Conclusion „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Conclusion „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>In the decision-making process for selecting development tools, a multifaceted approach is recommended. While direct coding provides unparalleled flexibility, it does come at the cost of development speed. The strategic integration of low-code tools and SaaS solutions can yield substantial gains in productivity.</p>
<p>For operations demanding flexibility and essential to the core business, traditional development methods remain the preferred choice. The agility and control afforded by traditional development methods result in products that are highly tailored to specific needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; the best choice is the one that aligns most closely with the unique requirements of the scenario at hand.</p>]]></content>

<p>If you want to develop large projects, have high customization requirements, and wish to use high-performance data components and chart components, especially in scenarios with high business complexity and are willing to subscribe to MUI X, it is recommended to use MUI for development. Its flexible configuration and plethora of components can fully meet your requirements.</p>
<p>‚ùå Disadvantages</p>
<p>If you need a lightweight framework and prefer to use a CSS-only solution for layout adjustments, it is not recommended here. MUI has a comprehensive proprietary design system, comes with a certain learning curve, and Material Design's aesthetics may not suit everyone. In such cases, exploring other open-source repositories might be more suitable.</p>]]></content>

<p>üí™üèº First Release Date: Dec 22, 2014</p>
<p>nvm is an open-source project that has been maintained for nearly 10 years. Positive reviews have kept this project robust and, through continuous maintenance, it has become a perfect solution for "Node.js version management."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="installing-nvm">Installing nvm<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/nvm-use-2024#installing-nvm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Installing nvm „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Installing nvm „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Since we are using a Mac for development, I strongly recommend using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> for package management and then using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> to install nvm.</p>
<p>To install Homebrew, it is recommended to use the installation script. It requires minimal configuration and allows immediate use. Moreover, Homebrew makes it easy to uninstall repositories cleanly if needed.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Running this command will install the latest version of Homebrew, automatically handling the installation of Xcode Command Tools in the MacOS environment.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is automated. Below is an installation process example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/homebrew-install.png" alt="homebrew_install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>After a short wait, we can proceed with the installation of nvm using the installed Homebrew.</p>

<p>After confirming agreement, nvm will be completely installed. If you decide you don't want it anymore, you can use the following command to uninstall:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"># delete nvm if you don't need it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; brew uninstall nvm</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<p>Once nvm is installed, here are some commonly used commands to help you get started. These commands should fulfill your daily needs.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm list</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "list" command displays various mainstream Node.js versions. You can install versions according to your needs, and it will also show the currently used Node.js version on your machine. It will display some codenames.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-list.png" alt="nvm_list" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>For example, "lts/gallim" is the version name for Node.js v16. To install using this codename, nvm will automatically install the latest version of v16. It's quite convenient. You can also use this command to check the currently used version.</p>
<p>Another command allows you to check the current Node.js version:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; node --version</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>After entering this command, you can verify whether the Node.js version has been successfully switched.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm install stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The second command installs a specific Node.js version; "stable" refers to a specific version number. You can also use the codename for a particular version. For example, to install "Node.js 18," you would use "nvm install 18." Here, I'm installing the "stable" version. nvm will automatically determine the latest Stable version and install it for me. After successful installation, it will automatically switch to the installed version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/stable-install.png" alt="stable-install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Where there's an installation command, there's also an uninstallation command. Use:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm uninstall stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-uninstall.png" alt="nvm-uninstall" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Once you've learned how to install and uninstall, the next important step is version switching.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm use stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="„ÇØ„É™„ÉÉ„Éó„Éú„Éº„Éâ„Å´„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Çí„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" title="„Ç≥„Éî„Éº" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "use" command allows you to quickly switch between Node.js versions currently in use. You can also use the "stable" codename. This way, you can quickly switch between versions for different projects.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-a-component-library">Why Choose a Component Library?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#why-choose-a-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why Choose a Component Library? „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Why Choose a Component Library? „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>In general, companies choose a component library when building web applications to streamline repetitive tasks. Component libraries offer a range of out-of-the-box components like Select, Input, CheckBox, etc. These components, with customizable styles or built-in attractive styles, enable rapid development of aesthetically pleasing websites without starting from scratch.</p>
<p>In summary, we typically use component libraries in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>External tools: Directly facing company users, usually aligned with the company's style, more aesthetically pleasing, and responsive.</li>
<li>Internal tools: Aimed at internal use by company employees, emphasizing design aesthetics and rapid functionality implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some detailed data about Shadcn:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚≠ê Github Stars: 37k</li>
<li>‚è¨ NPM Downloads: 23,962 downloads per week</li>
<li>üí™üèº First Release Date: Mar 8, 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>Shadcn UI is a relatively new project that gained 37k stars in less than a year, indicating its rapid recognition in the open-source community.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/shadcn-ui-2024/shadcn-ui.png" alt="shadcn-ui" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="design">Design<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Design „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Design „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>In terms of design, Shadcn UI leans towards a business style with a clean UI, suitable for internal tools and serious application scenarios. Shadcn UI supports custom themes, but it seems to offer customization only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Border radii</li>
<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>
<li>Predefined "Default" and "New York" styles</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of fine-grained control, such as font and font size, it appears to lack flexibility. However, for internal tool scenarios, this level of control may be sufficient, but for external tools, it might be somewhat limiting.</p>
<p>In terms of CSS, Shadcn UI supports both traditional CSS and CSS-in-JS, using <a href="https://stitches.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stitches</a> for the CSS-in-JS solution. Traditional CSS is supported by default, but additional configuration might be needed for less and sass, and it's not out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="richness-of-features">Richness of Features<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#richness-of-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Richness of Features „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Richness of Features „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The library's feature richness completely satisfies daily development needs, with most capabilities supported and comprehensive callbacks. Shadcn UI supports crucial capabilities, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSR</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Animation</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for more advanced requirements like extremely rich charts and high-performance tables, it seems not to be supported. With the continuous development of the project, it is expected that the project will evolve over time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-choose">How to Choose<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#how-to-choose" class="hash-link" aria-label="How to Choose „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="How to Choose „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>‚úÖ Advantages</p>
<p>If you are a curious open-source enthusiast, not requiring highly customized UI, and without complex data processing needs, Shadcn UI is recommended for development. It is lightweight, with simpler configuration, ready to use out-of-the-box, allowing direct development without worrying about details.</p>
<p>‚ùå Disadvantages</p>
<p>If you have a high need for UI and component customization and plan to use Shadcn UI for large projects, it is not recommended. Shadcn UI's customization capabilities are not as robust, and it does not provide out-of-the-box charts and high-performance data components. In such cases, you may need to look for other open-source projects to supplement these features.</p>]]></content>

<p>Shadcn UI leans towards a business style in its design, featuring a clean UI suitable for internal tools and serious application scenarios. Shadcn UI also supports custom themes, although it seems limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Rounded corners</li>
<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>
<li>Predefined "Default Style" and "New York Style"</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of design details such as font and font size, the control appears limited, satisfying basic design needs. However, for external tool scenarios, it may have some limitations.</p>
<p>Shadcn UI supports both CSS and CSS-in-JS solutions. The CSS-in-JS solution uses <a href="https://stitches.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stitches</a>, and while CSS defaults to traditional CSS, additional configuration may be needed for less and sass, and it is not out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>In terms of CSS support, MUI has its custom system, using emotionjs for style adjustment in the overall layout. This may involve a learning curve and may not be as developer-friendly, requiring documentation consultation for some style modifications.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="richness-of-features-1">Richness of Features<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/shadcn-vs-mui#richness-of-features-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Richness of Features „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Richness of Features „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>MUI categorizes its components into several dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUI Core: Basic functional components and a style system.</li>
<li>MUI X: High-performance and complex components, including high-performance tables, charts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For developing a complex system, you can use MUI's comprehensive solution. However, MUI X is a paid component library, requiring a subscription fee.</p>
<p>MUI is a heavyweight repository with extensive code and a long maintenance history, offering high customizability, making it suitable for large projects. The repository contains numerous features.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-choose">How to Choose<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/shadcn-vs-mui#how-to-choose" class="hash-link" aria-label="How to Choose „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="How to Choose „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>If you are a curious open-source enthusiast who does not need highly customized UI for product development, and there are no complex data processing requirements, Shadcn UI is recommended. It is more lightweight, simpler to configure, but less powerful. However, it is sufficient for internal tool scenarios.</p>
<p>If you need a component library for developing large and complex projects, require intricate charts, high-performance data components, and are willing to invest in a fee without looking for additional solutions, you can choose MUI. Its powerful capabilities make it an excellent choice for developing medium to large projects.</p>]]></content>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-low-code-tools">Why Choose Low-Code Tools?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/top-5-best-open-source-low-code-platforms-in-2024#why-choose-low-code-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why Choose Low-Code Tools? „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Why Choose Low-Code Tools? „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The emergence of low-code tools primarily addresses the issue of low development efficiency. These tools assist developers in rapidly constructing complete projects without starting from scratch, significantly boosting development efficiency. Development using low-code tools requires no coding; instead, developers can drag and drop components to build pages. This allows developers to focus more on implementing business logic without concerning themselves with page construction. Moreover, there is no need for any maintenance work; deploying the code to a server is sufficient, allowing developers to concentrate on business logic implementation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-open-source">Why Choose Open Source?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/top-5-best-open-source-low-code-platforms-in-2024#why-choose-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why Choose Open Source? „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ" title="Why Choose Open Source? „Å∏„ÅÆÁõ¥Êé•„É™„É≥„ÇØ">‚Äã</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Editable for customization</li>
<li>Deployable independently</li>
<li>Community collaboration for faster issue resolution</li>
<li>Abundant community template resources</li>
