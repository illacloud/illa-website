            "content_html": "<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces such as web pages or mobile apps. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that models should be able to do on data. CRUD applications are very common in web development, as they allow users to perform basic operations on data without writing complex code.</p>\n<p>CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. The database is where the data is stored and retrieved. The user interface is the front end that users interact with. The API contains the code and methods that communicate with the database. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we will review some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We will also provide some examples and tips on how to use them effectively.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"database\">Database<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#database\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Database への直接リンク\" title=\"Database への直接リンク\">​</a></h2>\n<p>The database is the core of any CRUD application, as it stores the data that users can create, read, update, and delete. There are many types of databases available, but they can be broadly categorized into two groups: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL).</p>\n<p>Relational databases use tables to store data; each table has a predefined schema and each row represents a record. Relational databases are good for structured and consistent data that requires complex queries and transactions. Some of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>\n<p>Non-relational databases use collections to store data, where each collection can have a flexible schema and each document represents a record. Non-relational databases are good for unstructured and dynamic data that require high scalability and performance. Some of the most popular non-relational databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase, and DynamoDB.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right database for your CRUD application depends on several factors, such as the type and volume of data you need to store, the level of consistency and reliability you need to ensure, and the complexity and frequency of queries you need to perform. You should also consider the compatibility and integration of your database with your user interface and API tools.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"user-interface\">User Interface<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#user-interface\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"User Interface への直接リンク\" title=\"User Interface への直接リンク\">​</a></h2>\n<p>The user interface is the front end of your CRUD application, where users can see and manipulate the data stored in your database. The user interface can be built using various technologies and frameworks, depending on the type and complexity of your application.</p>\n<p>One of the most common ways to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, CSS styles the appearance and layout of your web page, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to your web page. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or use libraries and frameworks that simplify and enhance your development process.</p>\n<p>Some of the most popular libraries and frameworks for building user interfaces are React, Angular, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, etc. These tools provide various features and benefits for creating dynamic and responsive web pages that can communicate with your API and database.</p>\n<p>Another way to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using low-code or no-code platforms. These platforms allow you to create web pages using drag-and-drop components and visual editors without writing much or any code. Some of the most popular low-code or no-code platforms are Budibase, Appsmith, Bubble.io, Webflow, etc. These tools are great for beginners or non-developers who want to create simple and fast CRUD applications without learning complex technologies.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"api\">API<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#api\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"API への直接リンク\" title=\"API への直接リンク\">​</a></h2>\n<p>The API is the bridge between your user interface and your database. It defines how your user interface can request data from your database or send data to your database using HTTP methods such as GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), or DELETE (delete). The API also handles authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, etc.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to build an API for your CRUD application, but one of the most common ways is using REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is an architectural style that defines how resources (data) can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods and formats such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are easy to understand and use by both humans and machines.</p>\n<p>Some of the most popular tools for building REST APIs are Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, etc. These tools are frameworks that provide various features and libraries for creating and managing web servers and APIs.</p>\n<p>Another way to build an API for your CRUD application is using GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language and a runtime that allows you to define and execute queries and mutations (operations) on your data using a single endpoint. GraphQL APIs are more flexible and efficient than REST APIs, as they allow you to request or send only the data you need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching.</p>\n<p>Some of the most popular tools for building GraphQL APIs are Apollo Server, Prisma, Hasura, Graphene, etc. These tools are libraries or platforms that help you create and manage GraphQL servers and schemas.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"tools-for-building-crud-applications\">Tools For Building Crud Applications<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#tools-for-building-crud-applications\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Tools For Building Crud Applications への直接リンク\" title=\"Tools For Building Crud Applications への直接リンク\">​</a></h2>\n<p>You will find many software claiming to provide ease in building useful CRUD Applications, but you need to be careful to find the ones that help in making the most compatible CRUD Applications.

A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png\" alt=\"dashboard\" class=\"img_CfaS\"></p>\n<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>\n<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>\n<li>AI voice processing panel</li>\n<li>Data analysis panel</li>\n<li>Content management CMS</li>\n<li>Custom CRM</li>\n<li>Management backend</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/solution.png\" alt=\"solution\" class=\"img_CfaS\"></p>\n<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>\n<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>\n<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>\n<li>Building CI/CD reporting systems</li>\n<li>Sending emails when certain warnings occur</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/flow.jpeg\" alt=\"flow\" class=\"img_CfaS\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"user-experience\">User Experience<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/popular-tool#user-experience\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"User Experience への直接リンク\" title=\"User Experience への直接リンク\">​</a></h2>\n<p>I briefly experienced it, and they have really put a lot of effort into the editor's smoothness and overall experience.

For backend engineers, integrating various services is indeed a nightmare. In this case, ILLA has already done the work. They also support integration with Huggingface, which seems like an official collaboration. It allows for quick use of the model capabilities on Huggingface, which is indeed interesting. You can quickly create some AI-driven tools.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/resource.png\" alt=\"resource\" class=\"img_CfaS\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/popular-tool#conclusion\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Conclusion への直接リンク\" title=\"Conclusion への直接リンク\">​</a></h2>\n<p>There are many low-code tools, but few can be practically used and implemented.

MUI's customization capabilities are extensive, catering to a wide range of internal and external scenarios. Many well-known open-source projects use MUI for front-end development. For most functionalities, MUI provides comprehensive support.</p>\n<p>In addition to common features like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colors</li>\n<li>Border radii</li>\n<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MUI supports complete configurations of fonts, font sizes, colors, and margins, making it a powerful tool as a project with ten years of development.</p>\n<p>Regarding CSS support, MUI has its custom system, utilizing emotionjs for style adjustments in the overall layout. This may come with a learning curve and may not be as developer-friendly for direct development, requiring documentation consultation for certain style modifications.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"richness-of-features\">Richness of Features<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/ja/blog/mui-2024#richness-of-features\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Richness of Features への直接リンク\" title=\"Richness of Features への直接リンク\">​</a></h3>\n<p>MUI's component types are highly complex, divided into several dimensions:</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MUI Core: Basic functional components of MUI, including a multitude of foundational components and a style system.</li>\n<li>MUI X: High-performance and complex components of MUI, including high-performance tables, charts, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are developing a highly complex system, you can use MUI's full suite solution. However, MUI X is a paid component library, and a subscription fee may be required.</p>\n<p>MUI is a heavyweight repository with extensive code and a long maintenance history. Its high customizability makes it suitable for large projects.

Its flexible configuration and plethora of components can fully meet your requirements.</p>\n<p>❌ Disadvantages</p>\n<p>If you need a lightweight framework and prefer to use a CSS-only solution for layout adjustments, it is not recommended here. MUI has a comprehensive proprietary design system, comes with a certain learning curve, and Material Design's aesthetics may not suit everyone. In such cases, exploring other open-source repositories might be more suitable.</p>",

However, with the long history of products, versioning becomes a common issue—some projects require new versions, while others need older ones. Managing multiple versions of Node.js has been a persistent challenge for developers.Currently, the open-source tool nvm addresses this issue. With simple command-line usage, developers can quickly switch between different versions of Node.js, allowing them to focus on development rather than wasting time on environment configuration.The predominant machines for frontend development are still Macbooks.
