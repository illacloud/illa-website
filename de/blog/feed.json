MUI's customization capabilities are extensive, catering to a wide range of internal and external scenarios. Many well-known open-source projects use MUI for front-end development. For most functionalities, MUI provides comprehensive support.</p>\n<p>In addition to common features like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colors</li>\n<li>Border radii</li>\n<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MUI supports complete configurations of fonts, font sizes, colors, and margins, making it a powerful tool as a project with ten years of development.</p>\n<p>Regarding CSS support, MUI has its custom system, utilizing emotionjs for style adjustments in the overall layout. This may come with a learning curve and may not be as developer-friendly for direct development, requiring documentation consultation for certain style modifications.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO\" id=\"richness-of-features\">Richness of Features<a href=\"https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/de/blog/mui-2024#richness-of-features\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direkter Link zu Richness of Features\" title=\"Direkter Link zu Richness of Features\">​</a></h3>\n<p>MUI's component types are highly complex, divided into several dimensions:</p>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MUI Core: Basic functional components of MUI, including a multitude of foundational components and a style system.</li>\n<li>MUI X: High-performance and complex components of MUI, including high-performance tables, charts, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are developing a highly complex system, you can use MUI's full suite solution. However, MUI X is a paid component library, and a subscription fee may be required.</p>\n<p>MUI is a heavyweight repository with extensive code and a long maintenance history.

Its flexible configuration and plethora of components can fully meet your requirements.</p>\n<p>❌ Disadvantages</p>\n<p>If you need a lightweight framework and prefer to use a CSS-only solution for layout adjustments, it is not recommended here. MUI has a comprehensive proprietary design system, comes with a certain learning curve, and Material Design's aesthetics may not suit everyone. In such cases, exploring other open-source repositories might be more suitable.</p>",

Managing multiple versions of Node.js has been a persistent challenge for developers.Currently, the open-source tool nvm addresses this issue. With simple command-line usage, developers can quickly switch between different versions of Node.js, allowing them to focus on development rather than wasting time on environment configuration.The predominant machines for frontend development are still Macbooks.
