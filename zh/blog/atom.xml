        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IT Support is divided into Technical Support and Program Support.</p>
<p>Technical Support requires technicians with a broad knowledge structure. Companies of a certain size all have an IT department, commonly referred to as network management, but not all companies have Program Support.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="job-content-of-it-support">Job Content of IT Support<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/it-support#job-content-of-it-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job Content of IT Support" title="Direct link to Job Content of IT Support">​</a></h2>
<p>In ordinary companies, the IT department's Technical Support is responsible for managing the company's information system, database, machinery hardware equipment, etc. If the company needs any special software or to update a new system, it is usually done by forming a team with programmers from a technology company and the company's own Program Support.</p>
<p>Technical Support is more like a consultant, guiding the more macroscopic direction, so they generally know a lot.</p>
<p>Program Support specializes more in coding.</p>

<p>Internal Tools refer to tools used within a team, including but not limited to various data dashboards, admin panels, etc. These tools can help the team better manage business operations and improve work efficiency. Tools drive the team's efficiency, and Internal Tools are an important part of these tools.</p>
<p>Every team needs to create a large number of non-standardized Internal Tools based on their own needs, making their team more efficient in managing business operations and data-driven decision-making.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it's a large or small company, Internal Tools are very important, and each company's Internal Tools are different. Therefore, a flexible tool is needed to create Internal Tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-illa-cloud-can-do">What ILLA Cloud Can Do<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/internal-tool#what-illa-cloud-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do" title="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do">​</a></h2>
<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>The main users of ILLA Cloud are backend engineers, which might be different from what most people think. A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>
<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>
<li>AI voice processing panel</li>
<li>Data analysis panel</li>
<li>Content management CMS</li>
<li>Custom CRM</li>
<li>Management backend</li>
</ul>
<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>
<li>Building CI/CD reporting systems</li>
<li>Sending emails when certain warnings occur</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/internal-tool/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>

<p>I briefly experienced it, and they have really put a lot of effort into the editor's smoothness and overall experience. The overall editing experience is quite good. It includes smooth drag-and-drop capabilities and also supports collaboration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/internal-tool/team.gif" alt="collabration" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Various database integration capabilities are also supported, allowing quick data reading and writing from various data sources and databases. For backend engineers, integrating various services is indeed a nightmare. In this case, ILLA has already done the work. They also support integration with Huggingface, which seems like an official collaboration. It allows for quick use of the model capabilities on Huggingface, which is indeed interesting. You can quickly create some AI-driven tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/internal-tool/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AI development has reached a point today where it's no longer a novelty, but rather widely applied in various fields. However, for most people, AI remains a high-barrier technology, requiring a significant amount of time and effort to learn before it can be applied effectively in practical work.</p>
<p>Each of us has our own unique needs, such as building text-to-image tools or writing tools specific to our work chains. There are numerous interesting models on HuggingFace, allowing us to quickly create our own AI tools based on these models, thereby making our work more intelligent!</p>
<p>Here is a recommended tool that allows users to build AI tools like assembling blocks:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="illa-cloud">ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/build-ai-tools#illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>The official website is: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>This open-source low-code tool's slogan is: <strong>Build AI Driven Business Tools</strong>. It focuses on helping users quickly build AI-driven tools. Users can construct pages through drag-and-drop. Then, by using three major functions, they can connect to AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>ILLA AI Agent</li>
<li>Models from HuggingFace</li>
<li>RestAPI to call OpenAI's interface</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for the quick creation of personalized AI tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="building-smart-applications">Building Smart Applications<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/build-ai-tools#building-smart-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Smart Applications" title="Direct link to Building Smart Applications">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we use OpenAI's text-to-image interface to build our own text-to-image panel, using tools built with ILLA Cloud, which offers certain advantages:</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/image-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/image-generator</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The generated images can be sent to any system or SaaS using the ILLA Flow feature.</li>
<li>The models used later can be called via RestAPI or through HuggingFace's models.</li>
<li>Built-in prompts can be added to ensure that the generated content is sufficiently customized.</li>
<li>The ILLA AI Agent feature can enrich the content's prompts, as not everyone is familiar with writing prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/image_generate_content.webp" alt="image_generate_content" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>I used several components here, quickly creating my own web panel through drag-and-drop, and then connected the logic through JavaScript, making it available for use by my team.</p>
<p>I built two examples; another is an AI voice processing panel.</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator</a></p>
<p>This panel has the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes transcription</li>
<li>Generation of meeting minutes</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slack作为许多人工作中的主要沟通工具，已成为必须每天打开的基本工具之一。支持强大的文本和媒体格式，Slack允许我们发送各种消息。作为开发者，我们有许多需要自动化的任务，例如：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>代码编译和构建</strong>：自动化代码编译过程，特别是在大型项目中，可以显著提高效率。</li>
<li><strong>测试执行</strong>：自动运行单元测试、集成测试和性能测试以确保代码质量。</li>
<li><strong>代码部署</strong>：自动化代码部署到生产环境或测试环境，这是持续集成/持续部署（CI/CD）流程中的常见做法。</li>
<li><strong>数据备份和恢复</strong>：定期自动备份数据库和应用程序数据，并在需要时进行恢复。</li>
<li><strong>监控和警报</strong>：自动监控系统和应用程序性能，并在出现问题时发送警报。</li>
<li><strong>日志文件管理</strong>：自动收集、分析和存档日志。</li>
<li><strong>环境配置</strong>：使用配置管理工具自动设置和维护开发、测试和生产环境。</li>
<li><strong>文档生成</strong>：从代码注释或数据库结构自动生成文档。</li>
<li><strong>批量数据或文件处理</strong>：自动执行数据转换、迁移或其他批量处理任务。</li>
<li><strong>依赖管理</strong>：自动管理项目依赖项，以确保使用最新和兼容的库和框架版本。</li>
</ul>
<p>这些任务通常通过各种工具和脚本自动化完成，例如使用Jenkins或GitHub Actions进行CI/CD流程，或使用Ansible、Puppet进行环境配置和管理。开发者使用许多工具来完成这些任务，但这些工具通常是独立的。完成任务后，我相信每个人都会欣赏综合性的更新通知。</p>
<p>研究表明，如果在问题创建时通过Slack通知，解决时间可以缩短50%。因此，我们需要一个工具来帮助我们自动发送消息到Slack，允许我们在一个地方查看所有消息，而不是检查各种工具。</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="连接器" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="解决方法">解决方法<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/automate-send-to-slack#%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 解决方法" title="Direct link to 解决方法">​</a></h2>

<p>ILLA Flow最独特的功能是将AI代理集成到工作流中的能力。这使您可以在发送通知之前使用由OpenAI模型创建的AI代理来处理通知，使通知变得更加智能和有趣。您还可以使用AI代理进行复杂的分析，简化以前具有挑战性的摘要。</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/agent.png" alt="代理" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="取得的结果">取得的结果<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/automate-send-to-slack#%E5%8F%96%E5%BE%97%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%9C" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 取得的结果" title="Direct link to 取得的结果">​</a></h2>
<p>我们可以在ILLA Flow中创建一个工作流，然后在工作流中调用Slack的Webhook来实现自动发送消息到Slack。</p>
<p>在完成CI/CD工具或每日计划任务后，我们可以在Slack中看到消息。</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="连接器" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>我们还可以将ILLA Flow连接到GitHub，允许我们在GitHub Issues中看到由ILLA Flow发送的消息。</p>
<p>我们还可以将ILLA Flow连接到警报监控系统，因此当发生警报或异常时，我们可以在Slack中看到消息。</p>
<p>最后，ILLA的另一款产品ILLA Builder支持构建自定义面板，允许我们通过Slack发送的链接直接跳转到ILLA Builder，以通过这些链接查看更多信息，使通知变得非常智能和详细。</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="结论">结论<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/automate-send-to-slack#%E7%BB%93%E8%AE%BA" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 结论" title="Direct link to 结论">​</a></h2>
<p>在日常工作中，存在许多自动化场景，而ILLA Flow是一个面向开发者的工具。大多数其他自动连接工具面向一般用户，这可能会使开发者的配置变得更加复杂。</p>
<p>使用ILLA Flow，您可以一键集成AI代理和各种SaaS，使内部团队的流程更加自动化，并使通知更加智能。</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Owen, a full-stack engineer with previous experience at TikTok. My role there involved developing the platform, known for its engaging short video content, and ensuring a delightful user experience.</p>
<p>I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.</p>
<p>All my data was stored on Supabase, and I developed a complete set of REST APIs for backend management. I realized that most of the work involved CRUD operations on Supabase. I needed a tool to help me quickly develop these Admin Panels.</p>
<p>So, I created an open-source project to assist in the rapid development of Admin Panels. This project is named ILLA Cloud.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-illa-cloud">What is ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/boost-freelancer#what-is-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>ILLA is a low-code tool designed for developers, allowing you to rapidly develop Admin Panels and Dashboards through a drag-and-drop interface. ILLA Cloud integrates with a wide range of common databases and data sources, including REST APIs and GraphQL.</p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>With ILLA, you can quickly build various tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panels</li>
<li>Data Dashboards</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be created with drag-and-drop ease, requiring only a minimal amount of JavaScript for logical connections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also features a comprehensive set of connector tools, capable of integrating AI, databases, and various SaaS platforms. This enables your clients to quickly link the products you build with the ones they use. It supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and also allows for parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-created-illa-cloud">Why I created ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-created-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>For freelancers, the most important thing is undoubtedly time, as time is money. I don't want to spend too much time on Admin Panels; I need a tool that helps me develop Admin Panels quickly. Additionally, for my clients, usability and aesthetic appeal are paramount. Therefore, using a low-code tool for development offers a very user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>With drag-and-drop, I can rapidly construct an Admin Panel that directly interacts with Supabase, without needing to write any code. This tool helps me quickly develop Admin Panels, allowing me to focus on developing business logic.</p>
<p>The reason I use Supabase is that it's an extremely user-friendly open-source project, which aids in swiftly setting up backend services. Moreover, its documentation is very accessible, making it easy for me to get started.</p>
<p>ILLA Cloud has an integration with Supabase. With SQL, I can quickly query and modify data in Supabase, facilitating rapid development of both Dashboards and Admin Panels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-recommend-illa-cloud">Why I recommend ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-recommend-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>You only need to pay $20 per month for ILLA, and this fee is solely for the use of ILLA's editor, which is very freelancer-friendly. You might need to interact with numerous clients, but you don't have to pay for the users; you only pay for yourself.</p>
<p>Additionally, ILLA comes with a ready-to-use Drive service. For file storage needs during development, you can directly use the Drive service, which aids in rapid development. Moreover, if your client has a high usage volume, you can have them recharge their account themselves, or they can come back to you for more. This can be very beneficial for closing follow-up deals.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces such as web pages or mobile apps. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that models should be able to do on data. CRUD applications are very common in web development, as they allow users to perform basic operations on data without writing complex code.</p>
<p>CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. The database is where the data is stored and retrieved. The user interface is the front end that users interact with. The API contains the code and methods that communicate with the database. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will review some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We will also provide some examples and tips on how to use them effectively.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="database">Database<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#database" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database" title="Direct link to Database">​</a></h2>
<p>The database is the core of any CRUD application, as it stores the data that users can create, read, update, and delete. There are many types of databases available, but they can be broadly categorized into two groups: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL).</p>
<p>Relational databases use tables to store data; each table has a predefined schema and each row represents a record. Relational databases are good for structured and consistent data that requires complex queries and transactions. Some of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>
<p>Non-relational databases use collections to store data, where each collection can have a flexible schema and each document represents a record. Non-relational databases are good for unstructured and dynamic data that require high scalability and performance. Some of the most popular non-relational databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase, and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Choosing the right database for your CRUD application depends on several factors, such as the type and volume of data you need to store, the level of consistency and reliability you need to ensure, and the complexity and frequency of queries you need to perform. You should also consider the compatibility and integration of your database with your user interface and API tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="user-interface">User Interface<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#user-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Interface" title="Direct link to User Interface">​</a></h2>
<p>The user interface is the front end of your CRUD application, where users can see and manipulate the data stored in your database. The user interface can be built using various technologies and frameworks, depending on the type and complexity of your application.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, CSS styles the appearance and layout of your web page, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to your web page. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or use libraries and frameworks that simplify and enhance your development process.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular libraries and frameworks for building user interfaces are React, Angular, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, etc. These tools provide various features and benefits for creating dynamic and responsive web pages that can communicate with your API and database.</p>
<p>Another way to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using low-code or no-code platforms. These platforms allow you to create web pages using drag-and-drop components and visual editors without writing much or any code. Some of the most popular low-code or no-code platforms are Budibase, Appsmith, Bubble.io, Webflow, etc. These tools are great for beginners or non-developers who want to create simple and fast CRUD applications without learning complex technologies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="api">API<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API" title="Direct link to API">​</a></h2>
<p>The API is the bridge between your user interface and your database. It defines how your user interface can request data from your database or send data to your database using HTTP methods such as GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), or DELETE (delete). The API also handles authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, etc.</p>
<p>There are many ways to build an API for your CRUD application, but one of the most common ways is using REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is an architectural style that defines how resources (data) can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods and formats such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are easy to understand and use by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building REST APIs are Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, etc. These tools are frameworks that provide various features and libraries for creating and managing web servers and APIs.</p>
<p>Another way to build an API for your CRUD application is using GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language and a runtime that allows you to define and execute queries and mutations (operations) on your data using a single endpoint. GraphQL APIs are more flexible and efficient than REST APIs, as they allow you to request or send only the data you need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building GraphQL APIs are Apollo Server, Prisma, Hasura, Graphene, etc. These tools are libraries or platforms that help you create and manage GraphQL servers and schemas.</p>

<p>Github: <a href="https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illa.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illa.cloud</a></p>
<p>The main users of ILLA Cloud are backend engineers, which might be different from what most people think. A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>
<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>
<li>AI voice processing panel</li>
<li>Data analysis panel</li>
<li>Content management CMS</li>
<li>Custom CRM</li>
<li>Management backend</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/solution.png" alt="solution" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>
<li>Building CI/CD reporting systems</li>
<li>Sending emails when certain warnings occur</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/flow.jpeg" alt="flow" class="img_CfaS"></p>

<p>I briefly experienced it, and they have really put a lot of effort into the editor's smoothness and overall experience. The overall editing experience is quite good. It includes smooth drag-and-drop capabilities and also supports collaboration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/team.gif" alt="collabration" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Various database integration capabilities are also supported, allowing quick data reading and writing from various data sources and databases. For backend engineers, integrating various services is indeed a nightmare. In this case, ILLA has already done the work. They also support integration with Huggingface, which seems like an official collaboration. It allows for quick use of the model capabilities on Huggingface, which is indeed interesting. You can quickly create some AI-driven tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/popular-tool#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>There are many low-code tools, but few can be practically used and implemented. ILLA seems to have been maintained for two years now, and their company is currently fully committed to this one thing. Unlike some low-code tools produced for certain purposes, they are directly addressing the needs of developers. Everyone can try it out!"</p>]]></content>

<p>在选择开发工具的决策过程中，建议采用多方面的方法。虽然直接编码提供了无与伦比的灵活性，但它确实以开发速度为代价。低代码工具和SaaS解决方案的战略整合可以带来显著的生产力提升。</p>
<p>对于要求灵活性且对核心业务至关重要的运营，传统开发方法仍是首选。传统开发方法所提供的敏捷性和控制权，使产品能够高度定制以满足特定需求。</p>
<p>最终，没有一种适合所有情况的解决方案；最佳选择是与手头场景的独特需求最为吻合的那一个。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 has arrived, and the ecosystem of React component libraries remains highly prosperous. This article will dissect two currently popular component libraries from various perspectives, providing an objective analysis to help users make more informed choices.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-a-component-library">Why Choose a Component Library?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#why-choose-a-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?" title="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?">​</a></h2>
<p>In general, every company building web applications tends to select a component library. These libraries address a significant amount of repetitive work, offering readily usable components such as Select, Input, CheckBox, and more. These components, customizable through styles or pre-existing attractive styles, enable the rapid creation of beautiful websites without the need to build extensive foundational features from scratch.</p>
<p>To summarize, component libraries are typically used in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>External tools: Directly targeted at company users, usually adhering to the company's style, more aesthetically pleasing, and responsive.</li>
<li>Internal tools: Aimed at internal use by company employees, focusing on aesthetic design while prioritizing rapid functionality implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will analyze two component libraries based on the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Richness of Features</li>
<li>How to Choose in Different Scenarios</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="other-choices-for-internal-tool-scenarios">Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#other-choices-for-internal-tool-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios" title="Direct link to Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILLA Cloud</a> is an out-of-the-box low-code tool that allows quick construction of internal tools with simple JS, without the need to create new projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panel</li>
<li>Data Dashboard</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to building with a component library, ILLA Cloud enables 10x faster tool construction and supports collaborative editing within teams.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="features-of-mui">Features of MUI<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#features-of-mui" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features of MUI" title="Direct link to Features of MUI">​</a></h2>
<p>Some detailed data about MUI:</p>
<ul>
<li>⭐ Github Stars: 90k</li>
<li>⏬ NPM Downloads: 3,263,852 downloads per week</li>
<li>💪🏼 First Release Date: Nov 6, 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>MUI, as a longstanding project maintained since 2014, boasts almost a decade of stability. Its high star count and weekly download numbers ensure that the community remains consistently active.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/mui-2024/mui.png" alt="mui" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="design">Design<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design" title="Direct link to Design">​</a></h3>
<p>In terms of design, MUI strictly adheres to Google's renowned Material Design. MUI's customization capabilities are extensive, catering to a wide range of internal and external scenarios. Many well-known open-source projects use MUI for front-end development. For most functionalities, MUI provides comprehensive support.</p>
<p>In addition to common features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Border radii</li>
<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>
</ul>
<p>MUI supports complete configurations of fonts, font sizes, colors, and margins, making it a powerful tool as a project with ten years of development.</p>
<p>Regarding CSS support, MUI has its custom system, utilizing emotionjs for style adjustments in the overall layout. This may come with a learning curve and may not be as developer-friendly for direct development, requiring documentation consultation for certain style modifications.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="richness-of-features">Richness of Features<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#richness-of-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Richness of Features" title="Direct link to Richness of Features">​</a></h3>
<p>MUI's component types are highly complex, divided into several dimensions:</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUI Core: Basic functional components of MUI, including a multitude of foundational components and a style system.</li>
<li>MUI X: High-performance and complex components of MUI, including high-performance tables, charts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are developing a highly complex system, you can use MUI's full suite solution. However, MUI X is a paid component library, and a subscription fee may be required.</p>
<p>MUI is a heavyweight repository with extensive code and a long maintenance history. Its high customizability makes it suitable for large projects. In the MUI repository, you can find a wealth of features.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-choose">How to Choose<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#how-to-choose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Choose" title="Direct link to How to Choose">​</a></h2>
<p>✅ Advantages</p>
<p>If you want to develop large projects, have high customization requirements, and wish to use high-performance data components and chart components, especially in scenarios with high business complexity and are willing to subscribe to MUI X, it is recommended to use MUI for development. Its flexible configuration and plethora of components can fully meet your requirements.</p>
<p>❌ Disadvantages</p>
<p>If you need a lightweight framework and prefer to use a CSS-only solution for layout adjustments, it is not recommended here. MUI has a comprehensive proprietary design system, comes with a certain learning curve, and Material Design's aesthetics may not suit everyone. In such cases, exploring other open-source repositories might be more suitable.</p>]]></content>

<p>⭐ GitHub Stars: 72.4k</p>
<p>💪🏼 First Release Date: Dec 22, 2014</p>
<p>nvm is an open-source project that has been maintained for nearly 10 years. Positive reviews have kept this project robust and, through continuous maintenance, it has become a perfect solution for "Node.js version management."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="installing-nvm">Installing nvm<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/nvm-use-2024#installing-nvm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing nvm" title="Direct link to Installing nvm">​</a></h2>
<p>Since we are using a Mac for development, I strongly recommend using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> for package management and then using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> to install nvm.</p>
<p>To install Homebrew, it is recommended to use the installation script. It requires minimal configuration and allows immediate use. Moreover, Homebrew makes it easy to uninstall repositories cleanly if needed.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Running this command will install the latest version of Homebrew, automatically handling the installation of Xcode Command Tools in the MacOS environment.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is automated. Below is an installation process example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/homebrew-install.png" alt="homebrew_install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>After a short wait, we can proceed with the installation of nvm using the installed Homebrew.</p>

<p>Once nvm is installed, here are some commonly used commands to help you get started. These commands should fulfill your daily needs.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm list</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "list" command displays various mainstream Node.js versions. You can install versions according to your needs, and it will also show the currently used Node.js version on your machine. It will display some codenames.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-list.png" alt="nvm_list" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>For example, "lts/gallim" is the version name for Node.js v16. To install using this codename, nvm will automatically install the latest version of v16. It's quite convenient. You can also use this command to check the currently used version.</p>
<p>Another command allows you to check the current Node.js version:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; node --version</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>After entering this command, you can verify whether the Node.js version has been successfully switched.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm install stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The second command installs a specific Node.js version; "stable" refers to a specific version number. You can also use the codename for a particular version. For example, to install "Node.js 18," you would use "nvm install 18." Here, I'm installing the "stable" version. nvm will automatically determine the latest Stable version and install it for me. After successful installation, it will automatically switch to the installed version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/stable-install.png" alt="stable-install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
