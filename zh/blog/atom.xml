        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ILLA Cloud is an open-source low-code development platform that helps users quickly build internal tools, including data dashboards, management backends, and AI tools. As an open-source low-code platform, using ILLA Cloud to create internal tools is a very good choice.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-internal-tools">What is Internal Tools<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/internal-tool#what-is-internal-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Internal Tools" title="Direct link to What is Internal Tools">​</a></h2>
<p>Internal Tools refer to tools used within a team, including but not limited to various data dashboards, admin panels, etc. These tools can help the team better manage business operations and improve work efficiency. Tools drive the team's efficiency, and Internal Tools are an important part of these tools.</p>
<p>Every team needs to create a large number of non-standardized Internal Tools based on their own needs, making their team more efficient in managing business operations and data-driven decision-making.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it's a large or small company, Internal Tools are very important, and each company's Internal Tools are different. Therefore, a flexible tool is needed to create Internal Tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-illa-cloud-can-do">What ILLA Cloud Can Do<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/internal-tool#what-illa-cloud-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do" title="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do">​</a></h2>
<p>Github: <a href="https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illa.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illa.cloud</a></p>
<p>The main users of ILLA Cloud are backend engineers, which might be different from what most people think. A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>
<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>
<li>AI voice processing panel</li>
<li>Data analysis panel</li>
<li>Content management CMS</li>
<li>Custom CRM</li>
<li>Management backend</li>
</ul>
<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>
<li>Building CI/CD reporting systems</li>
<li>Sending emails when certain warnings occur</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/internal-tool/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="user-experience">User Experience<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/internal-tool#user-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Experience" title="Direct link to User Experience">​</a></h2>
<p>I briefly experienced it, and they have really put a lot of effort into the editor's smoothness and overall experience. The overall editing experience is quite good. It includes smooth drag-and-drop capabilities and also supports collaboration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/internal-tool/team.gif" alt="collabration" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Various database integration capabilities are also supported, allowing quick data reading and writing from various data sources and databases. For backend engineers, integrating various services is indeed a nightmare. In this case, ILLA has already done the work. They also support integration with Huggingface, which seems like an official collaboration. It allows for quick use of the model capabilities on Huggingface, which is indeed interesting. You can quickly create some AI-driven tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/internal-tool/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/internal-tool#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>If you are choosing an open-source low-code platform, ILLA Cloud is an excellent option. It can help you quickly build Internal Tools, enhancing your team's work efficiency.</p>
<p>Finally, it is hoped that every team can use Internal Tools to drive their business growth and build the most efficient team.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AI development has reached a point today where it's no longer a novelty, but rather widely applied in various fields. However, for most people, AI remains a high-barrier technology, requiring a significant amount of time and effort to learn before it can be applied effectively in practical work.</p>
<p>Each of us has our own unique needs, such as building text-to-image tools or writing tools specific to our work chains. There are numerous interesting models on HuggingFace, allowing us to quickly create our own AI tools based on these models, thereby making our work more intelligent!</p>
<p>Here is a recommended tool that allows users to build AI tools like assembling blocks:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="illa-cloud">ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/build-ai-tools#illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>The official website is: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>Github: <a href="https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>This open-source low-code tool's slogan is: <strong>Build AI Driven Business Tools</strong>. It focuses on helping users quickly build AI-driven tools. Users can construct pages through drag-and-drop. Then, by using three major functions, they can connect to AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>ILLA AI Agent</li>
<li>Models from HuggingFace</li>
<li>RestAPI to call OpenAI's interface</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for the quick creation of personalized AI tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="building-smart-applications">Building Smart Applications<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/build-ai-tools#building-smart-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Smart Applications" title="Direct link to Building Smart Applications">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we use OpenAI's text-to-image interface to build our own text-to-image panel, using tools built with ILLA Cloud, which offers certain advantages:</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/image-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/image-generator</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The generated images can be sent to any system or SaaS using the ILLA Flow feature.</li>
<li>The models used later can be called via RestAPI or through HuggingFace's models.</li>
<li>Built-in prompts can be added to ensure that the generated content is sufficiently customized.</li>
<li>The ILLA AI Agent feature can enrich the content's prompts, as not everyone is familiar with writing prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/image_generate_content.webp" alt="image_generate_content" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>I used several components here, quickly creating my own web panel through drag-and-drop, and then connected the logic through JavaScript, making it available for use by my team.</p>
<p>I built two examples; another is an AI voice processing panel.</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator</a></p>
<p>This panel has the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes transcription</li>
<li>Generation of meeting minutes</li>
<li>Translation and dubbing of meeting minutes</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/mix_ai_voice.webp" alt="mix_ai_voice" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>It primarily uses OpenAI's Whisper capability. There are thousands of AI capabilities, but the most important is to find what suits you. Using ILLA Cloud, you can quickly build AI applications like building blocks. Start using it now!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/build-ai-tools#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>From the above introduction, we can see that using ILLA Cloud, you can quickly build your own AI tools, and ILLA Cloud has a rich array of components, basically meeting a large number of everyday business needs.</p>
<p>ILLA's self-developed component library has made the above functions flexible enough. Come and use ILLA Cloud to build your own AI tools!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slack, as a primary communication tool for many people's work, has become one of the essential tools that must be opened daily. Supporting powerful text and media formats, Slack allows us to send various messages. As developers, we have a multitude of tasks that need to be automated, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Compilation and Building</strong>: Automating the process of code compilation, especially in large projects, can significantly improve efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Test Execution</strong>: Automatically running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to ensure code quality.</li>
<li><strong>Code Deployment</strong>: Automating code deployment to production or test environments, a common practice in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes.</li>
<li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery</strong>: Regularly automating database and application data backups, and restoring them when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Alerts</strong>: Automating the monitoring of system and application performance and sending alerts in case of issues.</li>
<li><strong>Log File Management</strong>: Automating the collection, analysis, and archiving of logs.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Configuration</strong>: Using configuration management tools to automatically set up and maintain development, testing, and production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Generation</strong>: Automatically generating documentation from code comments or database structures.</li>
<li><strong>Batch Processing of Data or Files</strong>: Automatically performing data transformations, migrations, or other batch processing tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Management</strong>: Automatically managing project dependencies to ensure the latest and compatible versions of libraries and frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks are usually automated through various tools and scripts, such as using Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes, or Ansible, Puppet for environment configuration and management. Developers use many tools to accomplish these tasks, but these tools are usually independent. After completing their tasks, I believe everyone would appreciate a comprehensive notification for updates.</p>
<p>Studies show that if an issue is notified via Slack at the time of creation, the resolution time can be reduced by 50%. Therefore, we need a tool to help us automate message sending to Slack, allowing us to see all messages in one place, rather than checking various tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-solve">How to Solve<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/automate-send-to-slack#how-to-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Solve" title="Direct link to How to Solve">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we choose a tool to solve this, named ILLA Flow. It is a connector tool aimed at developers, helping them quickly build various automation tasks, including automating message sending to Slack.</p>
<p>ILLA Flow offers various integrations, including but not limited to the most commonly used RestAPI, GraphQL, and a vast number of database connections and various SaaS platform capabilities, allowing you to quickly connect your products with those used by your customers. ILLA Flow also supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>The most unique feature of ILLA Flow is the ability to incorporate an AI Agent into the workflow. This allows you to use an AI Agent, created by OpenAI's model, to process your notifications before sending them, making the notifications smarter and more interesting. You can also use the AI Agent for complex analyses, simplifying previously challenging summaries.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/agent.png" alt="agent" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="achieved-results">Achieved Results<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/automate-send-to-slack#achieved-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Achieved Results" title="Direct link to Achieved Results">​</a></h2>
<p>We can create a workflow in ILLA Flow and then call Slack's Webhook in the workflow to achieve automated message sending to Slack.</p>
<p>After the completion of CI/CD tools, or after daily scheduled tasks, we can see messages in Slack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>We can also connect ILLA Flow to GitHub, allowing us to see messages sent by ILLA Flow in GitHub Issues.</p>
<p>We can also connect ILLA Flow to the alert monitoring system, so when an alarm or anomaly occurs, we can see messages in Slack.</p>
<p>Finally, another product of ILLA, ILLA Builder, supports building custom panels, allowing us to jump directly to ILLA Builder to view more information through the links sent in Slack, making notifications very smart and detailed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/automate-send-to-slack#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>In daily work, there are numerous automation scenarios, and ILLA Flow is a tool aimed at developers. Most other automation connection tools are geared towards general users, which can make configuration more complex for developers.</p>
<p>Using ILLA Flow, you can integrate AI Agents and various SaaS with one click, making internal team processes more automated and notifications smarter.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Owen, a full-stack engineer with previous experience at TikTok. My role there involved developing the platform, known for its engaging short video content, and ensuring a delightful user experience.</p>
<p>I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.</p>
<p>All my data was stored on Supabase, and I developed a complete set of REST APIs for backend management. I realized that most of the work involved CRUD operations on Supabase. I needed a tool to help me quickly develop these Admin Panels.</p>
<p>So, I created an open-source project to assist in the rapid development of Admin Panels. This project is named ILLA Cloud.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-illa-cloud">What is ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/boost-freelancer#what-is-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>ILLA is a low-code tool designed for developers, allowing you to rapidly develop Admin Panels and Dashboards through a drag-and-drop interface. ILLA Cloud integrates with a wide range of common databases and data sources, including REST APIs and GraphQL.</p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>With ILLA, you can quickly build various tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panels</li>
<li>Data Dashboards</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be created with drag-and-drop ease, requiring only a minimal amount of JavaScript for logical connections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also features a comprehensive set of connector tools, capable of integrating AI, databases, and various SaaS platforms. This enables your clients to quickly link the products you build with the ones they use. It supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and also allows for parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-created-illa-cloud">Why I created ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-created-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>For freelancers, the most important thing is undoubtedly time, as time is money. I don't want to spend too much time on Admin Panels; I need a tool that helps me develop Admin Panels quickly. Additionally, for my clients, usability and aesthetic appeal are paramount. Therefore, using a low-code tool for development offers a very user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>With drag-and-drop, I can rapidly construct an Admin Panel that directly interacts with Supabase, without needing to write any code. This tool helps me quickly develop Admin Panels, allowing me to focus on developing business logic.</p>
<p>The reason I use Supabase is that it's an extremely user-friendly open-source project, which aids in swiftly setting up backend services. Moreover, its documentation is very accessible, making it easy for me to get started.</p>
<p>ILLA Cloud has an integration with Supabase. With SQL, I can quickly query and modify data in Supabase, facilitating rapid development of both Dashboards and Admin Panels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-recommend-illa-cloud">Why I recommend ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-recommend-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>You only need to pay $20 per month for ILLA, and this fee is solely for the use of ILLA's editor, which is very freelancer-friendly. You might need to interact with numerous clients, but you don't have to pay for the users; you only pay for yourself.</p>
<p>Additionally, ILLA comes with a ready-to-use Drive service. For file storage needs during development, you can directly use the Drive service, which aids in rapid development. Moreover, if your client has a high usage volume, you can have them recharge their account themselves, or they can come back to you for more. This can be very beneficial for closing follow-up deals.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Database GUI tools make working with SQL databases much simpler and more efficient for developers. Many great database GUIs are available, each with different features and capabilities. In this blog post, we'll look at seven of the best database GUIs to help you choose the right one.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="database-guis-and-why-they-are-important">Database GUIs and why they are important<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/top-7-database-guis-for-sql-databases#database-guis-and-why-they-are-important" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database GUIs and why they are important" title="Direct link to Database GUIs and why they are important">​</a></h2>
<p>Database GUIs are essential tools for database developers, database administrators, and database management systems users. Database management tools enable database developers to edit and manage MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and browse the database schema on Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.</p>
<p>Popular databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle MySQL Database, and Oracle MySQL server also benefit from this technology through comprehensive cross-platform GUI database management tools. GUI database management tools allow users to construct complex query builders for their databases with just a mouse click instead of manually entering complex SQL statements.</p>
<p>Web-based GUIs are becoming increasingly popular as they allow those with access to a web browser to easily manage their databases from any system, including Windows, Linux, and Mac.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces such as web pages or mobile apps. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that models should be able to do on data. CRUD applications are very common in web development, as they allow users to perform basic operations on data without writing complex code.</p>
<p>CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. The database is where the data is stored and retrieved. The user interface is the front end that users interact with. The API contains the code and methods that communicate with the database. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will review some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We will also provide some examples and tips on how to use them effectively.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="database">Database<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#database" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database" title="Direct link to Database">​</a></h2>
<p>The database is the core of any CRUD application, as it stores the data that users can create, read, update, and delete. There are many types of databases available, but they can be broadly categorized into two groups: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL).</p>
<p>Relational databases use tables to store data; each table has a predefined schema and each row represents a record. Relational databases are good for structured and consistent data that requires complex queries and transactions. Some of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>
<p>Non-relational databases use collections to store data, where each collection can have a flexible schema and each document represents a record. Non-relational databases are good for unstructured and dynamic data that require high scalability and performance. Some of the most popular non-relational databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase, and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Choosing the right database for your CRUD application depends on several factors, such as the type and volume of data you need to store, the level of consistency and reliability you need to ensure, and the complexity and frequency of queries you need to perform. You should also consider the compatibility and integration of your database with your user interface and API tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="user-interface">User Interface<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#user-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Interface" title="Direct link to User Interface">​</a></h2>
<p>The user interface is the front end of your CRUD application, where users can see and manipulate the data stored in your database. The user interface can be built using various technologies and frameworks, depending on the type and complexity of your application.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, CSS styles the appearance and layout of your web page, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to your web page. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or use libraries and frameworks that simplify and enhance your development process.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular libraries and frameworks for building user interfaces are React, Angular, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, etc. These tools provide various features and benefits for creating dynamic and responsive web pages that can communicate with your API and database.</p>
<p>Another way to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using low-code or no-code platforms. These platforms allow you to create web pages using drag-and-drop components and visual editors without writing much or any code. Some of the most popular low-code or no-code platforms are Budibase, Appsmith, Bubble.io, Webflow, etc. These tools are great for beginners or non-developers who want to create simple and fast CRUD applications without learning complex technologies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="api">API<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API" title="Direct link to API">​</a></h2>
<p>The API is the bridge between your user interface and your database. It defines how your user interface can request data from your database or send data to your database using HTTP methods such as GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), or DELETE (delete). The API also handles authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, etc.</p>
<p>There are many ways to build an API for your CRUD application, but one of the most common ways is using REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is an architectural style that defines how resources (data) can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods and formats such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are easy to understand and use by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building REST APIs are Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, etc. These tools are frameworks that provide various features and libraries for creating and managing web servers and APIs.</p>
<p>Another way to build an API for your CRUD application is using GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language and a runtime that allows you to define and execute queries and mutations (operations) on your data using a single endpoint. GraphQL APIs are more flexible and efficient than REST APIs, as they allow you to request or send only the data you need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building GraphQL APIs are Apollo Server, Prisma, Hasura, Graphene, etc. These tools are libraries or platforms that help you create and manage GraphQL servers and schemas.</p>

<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces. CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we reviewed some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We also provided some examples and tips on how to use them effectively. We hope this post helped you learn more about CRUD applications and how to build them.</p>

<p>The community indeed has some good reviews.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-illa-cloud-can-do">What ILLA Cloud Can Do<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/popular-tool#what-illa-cloud-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do" title="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do">​</a></h2>
<p>Github: <a href="https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illa.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illa.cloud</a></p>
<p>The main users of ILLA Cloud are backend engineers, which might be different from what most people think. A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>
<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>
<li>AI voice processing panel</li>
<li>Data analysis panel</li>
<li>Content management CMS</li>
<li>Custom CRM</li>
<li>Management backend</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/solution.png" alt="solution" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>
<li>Building CI/CD reporting systems</li>
<li>Sending emails when certain warnings occur</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/flow.jpeg" alt="flow" class="img_CfaS"></p>

<p>I briefly experienced it, and they have really put a lot of effort into the editor's smoothness and overall experience. The overall editing experience is quite good. It includes smooth drag-and-drop capabilities and also supports collaboration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/team.gif" alt="collabration" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Various database integration capabilities are also supported, allowing quick data reading and writing from various data sources and databases. For backend engineers, integrating various services is indeed a nightmare. In this case, ILLA has already done the work. They also support integration with Huggingface, which seems like an official collaboration. It allows for quick use of the model capabilities on Huggingface, which is indeed interesting. You can quickly create some AI-driven tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/popular-tool#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>There are many low-code tools, but few can be practically used and implemented. ILLA seems to have been maintained for two years now, and their company is currently fully committed to this one thing. Unlike some low-code tools produced for certain purposes, they are directly addressing the needs of developers. Everyone can try it out!"</p>]]></content>

<p>In the dynamic landscape of frequent holidays and special occasions, creating distinct online experiences becomes imperative. Each company may have its unique marketing days, requiring engaging activities. Crafting these online marketing campaigns inevitably poses a development challenge, necessitating substantial resource allocation. While the need for visually captivating designs is evident, the overall complexity may not justify significant development costs, especially when the lifecycle is limited to 1-2 weeks. In such cases, opting for low-code tools emerges as a financially prudent decision. Here, we advocate for a specific low-code solution.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="addressing-user-facing-components-webflow">Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#addressing-user-facing-components-webflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow" title="Direct link to Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow">​</a></h3>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="managing-business-operations-illa-cloud">Managing Business Operations: ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#managing-business-operations-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Managing Business Operations: ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Managing Business Operations: ILLA Cloud">​</a></h3>
<p>Regardless of the frontend technology used, an effective management tool is indispensable for overseeing business operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILLA Cloud</a>, as an out-of-the-box low-code tool, empowers developers to rapidly construct internal tools using straightforward JavaScript, eliminating the need to create new projects.</p>

<p>Compared to scenarios relying on component libraries, ILLA Cloud boasts a 10x faster construction speed for the aforementioned tools. Additionally, ILLA Cloud supports collaborative editing among multiple team members, fostering efficient teamwork.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>The synergy of these two tools expedites the creation of business requirements in marketing scenarios. This synergistic approach minimizes the need for extensive development resources while addressing the demand for quick response and deployment. Consequently, it propels the business iteration speed to new heights.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="when-initiating-a-novel-business-venture">When Initiating a Novel Business Venture<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#when-initiating-a-novel-business-venture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When Initiating a Novel Business Venture" title="Direct link to When Initiating a Novel Business Venture">​</a></h2>
<p>The commencement of a project necessitates a thorough evaluation of its characteristics. For comprehensive toC products such as social platforms, gaming applications, or IM services, the recommendation leans towards traditional development methodologies. This ensures a high degree of flexibility in adapting to evolving requirements.</p>
<p>For ventures centered around retail or services, the utilization of Shopify for frontend presentation proves advantageous. This choice guarantees widespread distribution of products while curbing development costs. Furthermore, Shopify supports customization, catering to diverse business needs effectively.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional/shopify.png" alt="shopify" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>In instances where a swift development of an app or website is paramount, direct coding may offer a faster solution. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate solution heavily relies on the unique attributes of the scenario.</p>
<p>If the backend functionality of Shopify falls short of requirements, the integration of ILLA Cloud can bridge the gap, providing a platform for customized management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>In the decision-making process for selecting development tools, a multifaceted approach is recommended. While direct coding provides unparalleled flexibility, it does come at the cost of development speed. The strategic integration of low-code tools and SaaS solutions can yield substantial gains in productivity.</p>
<p>For operations demanding flexibility and essential to the core business, traditional development methods remain the preferred choice. The agility and control afforded by traditional development methods result in products that are highly tailored to specific needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; the best choice is the one that aligns most closely with the unique requirements of the scenario at hand.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 has arrived, and the ecosystem of React component libraries remains highly prosperous. This article will dissect two currently popular component libraries from various perspectives, providing an objective analysis to help users make more informed choices.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-a-component-library">Why Choose a Component Library?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#why-choose-a-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?" title="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?">​</a></h2>
<p>In general, every company building web applications tends to select a component library. These libraries address a significant amount of repetitive work, offering readily usable components such as Select, Input, CheckBox, and more. These components, customizable through styles or pre-existing attractive styles, enable the rapid creation of beautiful websites without the need to build extensive foundational features from scratch.</p>
<p>To summarize, component libraries are typically used in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>External tools: Directly targeted at company users, usually adhering to the company's style, more aesthetically pleasing, and responsive.</li>
<li>Internal tools: Aimed at internal use by company employees, focusing on aesthetic design while prioritizing rapid functionality implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will analyze two component libraries based on the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Richness of Features</li>
<li>How to Choose in Different Scenarios</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="other-choices-for-internal-tool-scenarios">Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#other-choices-for-internal-tool-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios" title="Direct link to Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios">​</a></h2>

<p>In terms of design, MUI strictly adheres to Google's renowned Material Design. MUI's customization capabilities are extensive, catering to a wide range of internal and external scenarios. Many well-known open-source projects use MUI for front-end development. For most functionalities, MUI provides comprehensive support.</p>
<p>In addition to common features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Border radii</li>
<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>
</ul>
<p>MUI supports complete configurations of fonts, font sizes, colors, and margins, making it a powerful tool as a project with ten years of development.</p>
<p>Regarding CSS support, MUI has its custom system, utilizing emotionjs for style adjustments in the overall layout. This may come with a learning curve and may not be as developer-friendly for direct development, requiring documentation consultation for certain style modifications.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="richness-of-features">Richness of Features<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#richness-of-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Richness of Features" title="Direct link to Richness of Features">​</a></h3>
<p>MUI's component types are highly complex, divided into several dimensions:</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUI Core: Basic functional components of MUI, including a multitude of foundational components and a style system.</li>
<li>MUI X: High-performance and complex components of MUI, including high-performance tables, charts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are developing a highly complex system, you can use MUI's full suite solution. However, MUI X is a paid component library, and a subscription fee may be required.</p>
<p>MUI is a heavyweight repository with extensive code and a long maintenance history. Its high customizability makes it suitable for large projects. In the MUI repository, you can find a wealth of features.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-choose">How to Choose<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/mui-2024#how-to-choose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Choose" title="Direct link to How to Choose">​</a></h2>
<p>✅ Advantages</p>
<p>If you want to develop large projects, have high customization requirements, and wish to use high-performance data components and chart components, especially in scenarios with high business complexity and are willing to subscribe to MUI X, it is recommended to use MUI for development. Its flexible configuration and plethora of components can fully meet your requirements.</p>
<p>❌ Disadvantages</p>
<p>If you need a lightweight framework and prefer to use a CSS-only solution for layout adjustments, it is not recommended here. MUI has a comprehensive proprietary design system, comes with a certain learning curve, and Material Design's aesthetics may not suit everyone. In such cases, exploring other open-source repositories might be more suitable.</p>]]></content>

<p>⭐ GitHub Stars: 72.4k</p>
<p>💪🏼 First Release Date: Dec 22, 2014</p>
<p>nvm is an open-source project that has been maintained for nearly 10 years. Positive reviews have kept this project robust and, through continuous maintenance, it has become a perfect solution for "Node.js version management."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="installing-nvm">Installing nvm<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/nvm-use-2024#installing-nvm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing nvm" title="Direct link to Installing nvm">​</a></h2>
<p>Since we are using a Mac for development, I strongly recommend using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> for package management and then using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> to install nvm.</p>
<p>To install Homebrew, it is recommended to use the installation script. It requires minimal configuration and allows immediate use. Moreover, Homebrew makes it easy to uninstall repositories cleanly if needed.</p>

<p>Once nvm is installed, here are some commonly used commands to help you get started. These commands should fulfill your daily needs.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm list</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "list" command displays various mainstream Node.js versions. You can install versions according to your needs, and it will also show the currently used Node.js version on your machine. It will display some codenames.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-list.png" alt="nvm_list" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>For example, "lts/gallim" is the version name for Node.js v16. To install using this codename, nvm will automatically install the latest version of v16. It's quite convenient. You can also use this command to check the currently used version.</p>
<p>Another command allows you to check the current Node.js version:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; node --version</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>After entering this command, you can verify whether the Node.js version has been successfully switched.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm install stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The second command installs a specific Node.js version; "stable" refers to a specific version number. You can also use the codename for a particular version. For example, to install "Node.js 18," you would use "nvm install 18." Here, I'm installing the "stable" version. nvm will automatically determine the latest Stable version and install it for me. After successful installation, it will automatically switch to the installed version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/stable-install.png" alt="stable-install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Where there's an installation command, there's also an uninstallation command. Use:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm uninstall stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>To delete the corresponding version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-uninstall.png" alt="nvm-uninstall" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Once you've learned how to install and uninstall, the next important step is version switching.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm use stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="复制代码到剪贴板" title="复制" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "use" command allows you to quickly switch between Node.js versions currently in use. You can also use the "stable" codename. This way, you can quickly switch between versions for different projects.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 has arrived, and the ecosystem of React component libraries remains vibrant. This article will dissect two currently popular component libraries from various perspectives, providing an objective analysis to help users make more informed choices.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-a-component-library">Why Choose a Component Library?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#why-choose-a-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?" title="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?">​</a></h2>
<p>In general, companies choose a component library when building web applications to streamline repetitive tasks. Component libraries offer a range of out-of-the-box components like Select, Input, CheckBox, etc. These components, with customizable styles or built-in attractive styles, enable rapid development of aesthetically pleasing websites without starting from scratch.</p>
<p>In summary, we typically use component libraries in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>External tools: Directly facing company users, usually aligned with the company's style, more aesthetically pleasing, and responsive.</li>
<li>Internal tools: Aimed at internal use by company employees, emphasizing design aesthetics and rapid functionality implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will analyze the Shadcn UI component library based on the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Richness of Features</li>
<li>How to Choose in Different Scenarios</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="other-choices-for-internal-tool-scenarios">Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#other-choices-for-internal-tool-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios" title="Direct link to Other Choices for Internal Tool Scenarios">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILLA Cloud</a> is an out-of-the-box low-code tool that allows quick construction of internal tools with simple JS, without the need to create new projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panel</li>

<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to building with a component library, ILLA Cloud enables 10x faster tool construction and supports collaborative editing within teams.</p>

<p>Some detailed data about Shadcn:</p>
<ul>
<li>⭐ Github Stars: 37k</li>
<li>⏬ NPM Downloads: 23,962 downloads per week</li>
<li>💪🏼 First Release Date: Mar 8, 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>Shadcn UI is a relatively new project that gained 37k stars in less than a year, indicating its rapid recognition in the open-source community.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/shadcn-ui-2024/shadcn-ui.png" alt="shadcn-ui" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="design">Design<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design" title="Direct link to Design">​</a></h3>
<p>In terms of design, Shadcn UI leans towards a business style with a clean UI, suitable for internal tools and serious application scenarios. Shadcn UI supports custom themes, but it seems to offer customization only for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Border radii</li>
<li>Dark mode / Light mode</li>
<li>Predefined "Default" and "New York" styles</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of fine-grained control, such as font and font size, it appears to lack flexibility. However, for internal tool scenarios, this level of control may be sufficient, but for external tools, it might be somewhat limiting.</p>
<p>In terms of CSS, Shadcn UI supports both traditional CSS and CSS-in-JS, using <a href="https://stitches.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stitches</a> for the CSS-in-JS solution. Traditional CSS is supported by default, but additional configuration might be needed for less and sass, and it's not out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="richness-of-features">Richness of Features<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#richness-of-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Richness of Features" title="Direct link to Richness of Features">​</a></h3>
<p>The library's feature richness completely satisfies daily development needs, with most capabilities supported and comprehensive callbacks. Shadcn UI supports crucial capabilities, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSR</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Animation</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for more advanced requirements like extremely rich charts and high-performance tables, it seems not to be supported. With the continuous development of the project, it is expected that the project will evolve over time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-choose">How to Choose<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/shadcn-ui-2024#how-to-choose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Choose" title="Direct link to How to Choose">​</a></h2>
<p>✅ Advantages</p>
<p>If you are a curious open-source enthusiast, not requiring highly customized UI, and without complex data processing needs, Shadcn UI is recommended for development. It is lightweight, with simpler configuration, ready to use out-of-the-box, allowing direct development without worrying about details.</p>
<p>❌ Disadvantages</p>
<p>If you have a high need for UI and component customization and plan to use Shadcn UI for large projects, it is not recommended. Shadcn UI's customization capabilities are not as robust, and it does not provide out-of-the-box charts and high-performance data components. In such cases, you may need to look for other open-source projects to supplement these features.</p>]]></content>

<p>In terms of design details such as font and font size, the control appears limited, satisfying basic design needs. However, for external tool scenarios, it may have some limitations.</p>
<p>Shadcn UI supports both CSS and CSS-in-JS solutions. The CSS-in-JS solution uses <a href="https://stitches.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stitches</a>, and while CSS defaults to traditional CSS, additional configuration may be needed for less and sass, and it is not out-of-the-box.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every company has its own exclusive online business, and as the business continues to update and iterate, the complexity of the business will continuously increase over time.</p>
<p>After the business complexity reaches a high level, internal teams need to view various data to make decisions for future strategies. Therefore, we need a flexible tool to create personalized data dashboards to meet the diverse customization needs of internal team members, especially the boss, and help the team iterate quickly.</p>
<p>Using efficient tools to leave work early every day.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="some-issues-in-the-construction">Some issues in the construction<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/zh/blog/build-dashboard#some-issues-in-the-construction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some issues in the construction" title="Direct link to Some issues in the construction">​</a></h2>
<p>The business of each company is distributed across different systems, and there are some connections between these systems. Some data needs to be queried using databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgresql</li>
<li>Mysql</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Some data comes from different types of microservices, possibly obtained from a specific API:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Detail API</li>
<li>Product Detail API</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>The most challenging thing is that some data requires merging and secondary processing of both database and API data.</p>
<p>These issues make it very troublesome to build a personalized data dashboard. If starting development from scratch, we need to adapt to different data sources, leading to a steep increase in engineering costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need a flexible tool for displaying data dashboards, as "development" is not the most important; "display" is.</p>
<p>This tool needs some objective advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich charts to display data from different dimensions.</li>
<li>Support for various mainstream data sources.</li>
<li>Simple installation and usage.</li>
</ul>
