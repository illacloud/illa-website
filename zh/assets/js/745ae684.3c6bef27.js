The main advantage of low-code platforms lies in their ability to rapidly iterate. This rapid iteration is key to swiftly responding to market changes, which in turn leads to quick market share acquisition. Gaining market share rapidly is essential for fast capital acquisition, and this swift capital influx fuels further rapid iteration. This cycle positions low-code platforms as the preferred choice for businesses to develop their operational systems in the coming years.Customer Relationship Management (CRM), a system essential for every business, stands as a significant application scenario for low-code platforms.
