The main advantage of low-code platforms lies in their ability to rapidly iterate. This rapid iteration is key to swiftly responding to market changes, which in turn leads to quick market share acquisition. Gaining market share rapidly is essential for fast capital acquisition, and this swift capital influx fuels further rapid iteration. This cycle positions low-code platforms as the preferred choice for businesses to develop their operational systems in the coming years.Customer Relationship Management (CRM), a system essential for every business, stands as a significant application scenario for low-code platforms.

This has alleviated the need to initiate projects from scratch, saving considerable time for more pivotal business endeavors. However, it's crucial to recognize that while low code accelerates development, it does so at the expense of some flexibility. As a result, not all solutions are well-suited for low-code development. Let's delve deeper into the analysis of scenarios that favor low-code tools versus those where traditional code development remains more appropriate. Throughout this exploration, the key comparison of low code versus traditional development remains paramount, emphasizing the critical importance of choosing the most efficient approach.",permalink:"/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional",formattedDate:"January 3, 2024",authors:[{name:"Owen Chen",title:"CEO",url:"https://github.com/smallSohoSolo",imageURL:"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7929686?v=4",key:"owen"}],readingTime:3.33,date:"2024-01-03T10:00:00.000Z"},{title:"Build core app dashboard at lightning speed",description:"The Core App Dashboard is the nerve center of any sophisticated application.
