With the evolution of low-code platforms, an increasing number of businesses are turning to these platforms to build their operational systems. The main advantage of low-code platforms lies in their ability to rapidly iterate. This rapid iteration is key to swiftly responding to market changes, which in turn leads to quick market share acquisition. Gaining market share rapidly is essential for fast capital acquisition, and this swift capital influx fuels further rapid iteration. This cycle positions low-code platforms as the preferred choice for businesses to develop their operational systems in the coming years.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM), a system essential for every business, stands as a significant application scenario for low-code platforms. This article will explore how to build a CRM system using a low-code platform.

## Why Build Your Own CRM?

While every business requires a CRM system, the ones currently available in the market are either too complex or overly simplistic, making it hard to meet specific business needs. As a result, many businesses opt to build their own CRM systems.

Using low-code tools to build a CRM system allows for rapid iteration and swift response to market changes. This cycle cements the future of low-code platforms as the go-to solution for businesses developing operational systems.

The flexible capabilities of low-code allow for quick, from-the-ground-up construction of fully customized CRM tools tailored to a company's unique requirements.

## Advantages of Low-Code Platforms

The primary advantage of low-code platforms is their ability to facilitate rapid iteration. This rapid iteration is crucial for quick response to market changes, which leads to swift market share and capital acquisition, feeding back into more rapid iteration. This cycle ensures that low-code platforms will remain the preferred choice for businesses building operational systems in the near future.

Building a CRM with low-code means focusing solely on business logic without worrying about operational costs or design styles. It empowers everyone to develop customized systems for their company and team.

Moreover, these systems are aesthetically pleasing and easily modifiable.
