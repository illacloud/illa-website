IT Support is divided into Technical Support and Program Support.

Technical Support requires technicians with a broad knowledge structure. Companies of a certain size all have an IT department, commonly referred to as network management, but not all companies have Program Support.

## Job Content of IT Support

In ordinary companies, the IT department's Technical Support is responsible for managing the company's information system, database, machinery hardware equipment, etc. If the company needs any special software or to update a new system, it is usually done by forming a team with programmers from a technology company and the company's own Program Support.

Technical Support is more like a consultant, guiding the more macroscopic direction, so they generally know a lot.

Program Support specializes more in coding.

5. **Suitability for High-Performance Teams**: Built for high-performance teams, Linear is likely optimized for efficiency and scalability, supporting teams in managing complex projects without performance degradation.

### Disadvantages

1. **Potential Over-Simplification**: While simplicity is an advantage, it might also mean that Linear lacks certain advanced features required by very large or complex projects, possibly limiting its utility for some specialized applications.

2. **Focus on Software Projects**: Linear’s specific focus on software projects suggests it may not be as well-suited for other types of project management, limiting its versatility for non-software teams.

4. **Potential for Vendor Lock-in**: Relying on a single platform for all DevOps needs may lead to vendor lock-in, where teams become dependent on GitLab and might face challenges if they decide to switch to another tool in the future.

5. **Cost Considerations**: While GitLab offers a variety of plans, including a free tier, the more advanced features, essential for larger teams and complex projects, are often part of their paid plans, which could be a significant expense for some organizations.
