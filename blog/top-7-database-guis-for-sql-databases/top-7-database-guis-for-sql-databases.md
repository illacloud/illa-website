Database GUI tools make working with SQL databases much simpler and more efficient for developers. Many great database GUIs are available, each with different features and capabilities. In this blog post, we'll look at seven of the best database GUIs to help you choose the right one.

## Database GUIs and why they are important

Database GUIs are essential tools for database developers, database administrators, and database management systems users. Database management tools enable database developers to edit and manage MySQL and PostgreSQL databases and browse the database schema on Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

Popular databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle MySQL Database, and Oracle MySQL server also benefit from this technology through comprehensive cross-platform GUI database management tools. GUI database management tools allow users to construct complex query builders for their databases with just a mouse click instead of manually entering complex SQL statements.

Web-based GUIs are becoming increasingly popular as they allow those with access to a web browser to easily manage their databases from any system, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. Using a database GUI is a much quicker way of managing your databases. It is also far more comprehensive when compared to entering SQL statements by hand. Allowing developers easy access to any database system's functionality makes database management significantly more accessible.
