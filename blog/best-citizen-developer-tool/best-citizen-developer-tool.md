In recent decades, application development has been the exclusive domain of IT programmers, but this might change in the future!

Considering the increasingly competitive business demands, the only way for enterprises to develop is to increase their business capabilities and accelerate delivery speeds without incurring additional costs.

To address the digital challenges faced by enterprises, Citizen Development (CD) paves the way for non-technical business users (also known as Citizen Developers). Using IT-approved Low Code/No Code (LCNC) platforms, it is possible to intuitively build enterprise applications in an efficient, flexible, and user-friendly environment.

## The Value of Citizen Development

According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), Citizen Development will be a disruptor of this new norm, and many low-code/no-code platforms have already demonstrated this to their clients and partners. In practical use, LCNC has proven its ability to significantly reduce the complexity of application development at a minimal cost. So far, many organizations have started adopting citizen development in their operations to stimulate rapid change and create a unique footprint in the community, thereby benefiting overall productivity. Particularly in today's digital realm, low-code/no-code plays a key role in helping businesses leverage the limitless potential offered by this new digital space and easily spark innovation.

## Recommended Tools

As a Citizen Developer with basic computer skills, you'll need various tools to assist in your work. Here are some recommended tools to make your job more efficient.
