Hi everyone, I'm Owen, and we are a startup company focused on low-code solutions. Our team is quite small, consisting of only 7 people.

Today, we launched our new product: ILLA Flow.

## ILLA Flow

ILLA Flow is a workflow product that allows you to construct a complete workflow in a manner similar to mind mapping, thereby enabling connections and scheduling with various databases and APIs.

You can build your own workflow through a drag-and-drop interface, and then execute your workflow by scheduling triggers or Webhook triggers.

The smooth drag-and-drop experience allows you to quickly build workflows without worrying about any integration issues. The entire system is driven by JavaScript, ensuring flexibility while also being developer-friendly.

- MySQL
- MariaDB,
- PostgreSQL

We will strive to expand support for more connectivity features.

## Some examples

ILLA Flow supports multiple trigger types, including scheduled triggers and Webhook triggers.

We use ILLA Flow to do lots of things, like:

- Send a message to Slack when a new user registers
- Report the number of stars on GitHub every day
- Book a meeting room every day
- ...

Our engineers use ILLA Flow to automate many tasks, like:

- Read some business data from databases and send to Slack every day
- Build a CI/CD report system
- Send email when some warning occurs
- ...

## Conclusion

ILLA Flow supports scheduled triggers and the use of Webhooks for triggering. As a low-code tool, ILLA also enables the construction of panels to drive multiple workflows, forming a complete business process. Currently, the product is entirely free and requires no costs.

Our initial intention in creating this product was to address the lack of developer-friendly workflow products on the market. We aim to build a complete low-code matrix product to provide a better experience. Moreover, we have achieved multi-person real-time collaboration, similar to the experience of editing in Figma, ensuring that a team can edit workflows together. 

As an early-stage product, there are still many features that are not perfect, and we hope everyone can provide valuable feedback to help us optimize it.
