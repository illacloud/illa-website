        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IT Support is divided into Technical Support and Program Support.</p>
<p>Technical Support requires technicians with a broad knowledge structure. Companies of a certain size all have an IT department, commonly referred to as network management, but not all companies have Program Support.</p>

<p>In ordinary companies, the IT department's Technical Support is responsible for managing the company's information system, database, machinery hardware equipment, etc. If the company needs any special software or to update a new system, it is usually done by forming a team with programmers from a technology company and the company's own Program Support.</p>
<p>Technical Support is more like a consultant, guiding the more macroscopic direction, so they generally know a lot.</p>
<p>Program Support specializes more in coding.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In recent decades, application development has been the exclusive domain of IT programmers, but this might change in the future!</p>
<p>Considering the increasingly competitive business demands, the only way for enterprises to develop is to increase their business capabilities and accelerate delivery speeds without incurring additional costs.</p>
<p>To address the digital challenges faced by enterprises, Citizen Development (CD) paves the way for non-technical business users (also known as Citizen Developers). Using IT-approved Low Code/No Code (LCNC) platforms, it is possible to intuitively build enterprise applications in an efficient, flexible, and user-friendly environment.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="the-value-of-citizen-development">The Value of Citizen Development<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/best-citizen-developer-tool#the-value-of-citizen-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Value of Citizen Development" title="Direct link to The Value of Citizen Development">​</a></h2>
<p>According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), Citizen Development will be a disruptor of this new norm, and many low-code/no-code platforms have already demonstrated this to their clients and partners. In practical use, LCNC has proven its ability to significantly reduce the complexity of application development at a minimal cost. So far, many organizations have started adopting citizen development in their operations to stimulate rapid change and create a unique footprint in the community, thereby benefiting overall productivity. Particularly in today's digital realm, low-code/no-code plays a key role in helping businesses leverage the limitless potential offered by this new digital space and easily spark innovation.</p>

<p>Internal Tools refer to tools used within a team, including but not limited to various data dashboards, admin panels, etc. These tools can help the team better manage business operations and improve work efficiency. Tools drive the team's efficiency, and Internal Tools are an important part of these tools.</p>
<p>Every team needs to create a large number of non-standardized Internal Tools based on their own needs, making their team more efficient in managing business operations and data-driven decision-making.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it's a large or small company, Internal Tools are very important, and each company's Internal Tools are different. Therefore, a flexible tool is needed to create Internal Tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-illa-cloud-can-do">What ILLA Cloud Can Do<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/internal-tool#what-illa-cloud-can-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do" title="Direct link to What ILLA Cloud Can Do">​</a></h2>

<p>The main users of ILLA Cloud are backend engineers, which might be different from what most people think. A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>
<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>
<li>AI voice processing panel</li>
<li>Data analysis panel</li>
<li>Content management CMS</li>
<li>Custom CRM</li>
<li>Management backend</li>
</ul>
<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>

<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>This open-source low-code tool's slogan is: <strong>Build AI Driven Business Tools</strong>. It focuses on helping users quickly build AI-driven tools. Users can construct pages through drag-and-drop. Then, by using three major functions, they can connect to AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>ILLA AI Agent</li>
<li>Models from HuggingFace</li>
<li>RestAPI to call OpenAI's interface</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for the quick creation of personalized AI tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="building-smart-applications">Building Smart Applications<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools#building-smart-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Smart Applications" title="Direct link to Building Smart Applications">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we use OpenAI's text-to-image interface to build our own text-to-image panel, using tools built with ILLA Cloud, which offers certain advantages:</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/image-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/image-generator</a></p>

<li>The generated images can be sent to any system or SaaS using the ILLA Flow feature.</li>
<li>The models used later can be called via RestAPI or through HuggingFace's models.</li>
<li>Built-in prompts can be added to ensure that the generated content is sufficiently customized.</li>
<li>The ILLA AI Agent feature can enrich the content's prompts, as not everyone is familiar with writing prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/image_generate_content.webp" alt="image_generate_content" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>I used several components here, quickly creating my own web panel through drag-and-drop, and then connected the logic through JavaScript, making it available for use by my team.</p>
<p>I built two examples; another is an AI voice processing panel.</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator</a></p>
<p>This panel has the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes transcription</li>
<li>Generation of meeting minutes</li>
<li>Translation and dubbing of meeting minutes</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/mix_ai_voice.webp" alt="mix_ai_voice" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>It primarily uses OpenAI's Whisper capability. There are thousands of AI capabilities, but the most important is to find what suits you. Using ILLA Cloud, you can quickly build AI applications like building blocks. Start using it now!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slack, as a primary communication tool for many people's work, has become one of the essential tools that must be opened daily. Supporting powerful text and media formats, Slack allows us to send various messages. As developers, we have a multitude of tasks that need to be automated, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Compilation and Building</strong>: Automating the process of code compilation, especially in large projects, can significantly improve efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Test Execution</strong>: Automatically running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to ensure code quality.</li>
<li><strong>Code Deployment</strong>: Automating code deployment to production or test environments, a common practice in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes.</li>
<li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery</strong>: Regularly automating database and application data backups, and restoring them when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Alerts</strong>: Automating the monitoring of system and application performance and sending alerts in case of issues.</li>
<li><strong>Log File Management</strong>: Automating the collection, analysis, and archiving of logs.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Configuration</strong>: Using configuration management tools to automatically set up and maintain development, testing, and production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Generation</strong>: Automatically generating documentation from code comments or database structures.</li>
<li><strong>Batch Processing of Data or Files</strong>: Automatically performing data transformations, migrations, or other batch processing tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Management</strong>: Automatically managing project dependencies to ensure the latest and compatible versions of libraries and frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks are usually automated through various tools and scripts, such as using Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes, or Ansible, Puppet for environment configuration and management. Developers use many tools to accomplish these tasks, but these tools are usually independent. After completing their tasks, I believe everyone would appreciate a comprehensive notification for updates.</p>
<p>Studies show that if an issue is notified via Slack at the time of creation, the resolution time can be reduced by 50%. Therefore, we need a tool to help us automate message sending to Slack, allowing us to see all messages in one place, rather than checking various tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-solve">How to Solve<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack#how-to-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Solve" title="Direct link to How to Solve">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we choose a tool to solve this, named ILLA Flow. It is a connector tool aimed at developers, helping them quickly build various automation tasks, including automating message sending to Slack.</p>
<p>ILLA Flow offers various integrations, including but not limited to the most commonly used RestAPI, GraphQL, and a vast number of database connections and various SaaS platform capabilities, allowing you to quickly connect your products with those used by your customers. ILLA Flow also supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>The most unique feature of ILLA Flow is the ability to incorporate an AI Agent into the workflow. This allows you to use an AI Agent, created by OpenAI's model, to process your notifications before sending them, making the notifications smarter and more interesting. You can also use the AI Agent for complex analyses, simplifying previously challenging summaries.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/agent.png" alt="agent" class="img_CfaS"></p>

<p>We can create a workflow in ILLA Flow and then call Slack's Webhook in the workflow to achieve automated message sending to Slack.</p>
<p>After the completion of CI/CD tools, or after daily scheduled tasks, we can see messages in Slack.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Owen, a full-stack engineer with previous experience at TikTok. My role there involved developing the platform, known for its engaging short video content, and ensuring a delightful user experience.</p>
<p>I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.</p>
<p>All my data was stored on Supabase, and I developed a complete set of REST APIs for backend management. I realized that most of the work involved CRUD operations on Supabase. I needed a tool to help me quickly develop these Admin Panels.</p>
<p>So, I created an open-source project to assist in the rapid development of Admin Panels. This project is named ILLA Cloud.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-illa-cloud">What is ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer#what-is-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>ILLA is a low-code tool designed for developers, allowing you to rapidly develop Admin Panels and Dashboards through a drag-and-drop interface. ILLA Cloud integrates with a wide range of common databases and data sources, including REST APIs and GraphQL.</p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>With ILLA, you can quickly build various tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panels</li>
<li>Data Dashboards</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be created with drag-and-drop ease, requiring only a minimal amount of JavaScript for logical connections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also features a comprehensive set of connector tools, capable of integrating AI, databases, and various SaaS platforms. This enables your clients to quickly link the products you build with the ones they use. It supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and also allows for parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-created-illa-cloud">Why I created ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-created-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>For freelancers, the most important thing is undoubtedly time, as time is money. I don't want to spend too much time on Admin Panels; I need a tool that helps me develop Admin Panels quickly. Additionally, for my clients, usability and aesthetic appeal are paramount. Therefore, using a low-code tool for development offers a very user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>With drag-and-drop, I can rapidly construct an Admin Panel that directly interacts with Supabase, without needing to write any code. This tool helps me quickly develop Admin Panels, allowing me to focus on developing business logic.</p>
<p>The reason I use Supabase is that it's an extremely user-friendly open-source project, which aids in swiftly setting up backend services. Moreover, its documentation is very accessible, making it easy for me to get started.</p>
<p>ILLA Cloud has an integration with Supabase. With SQL, I can quickly query and modify data in Supabase, facilitating rapid development of both Dashboards and Admin Panels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-recommend-illa-cloud">Why I recommend ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-recommend-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>You only need to pay $20 per month for ILLA, and this fee is solely for the use of ILLA's editor, which is very freelancer-friendly. You might need to interact with numerous clients, but you don't have to pay for the users; you only pay for yourself.</p>
<p>Additionally, ILLA comes with a ready-to-use Drive service. For file storage needs during development, you can directly use the Drive service, which aids in rapid development. Moreover, if your client has a high usage volume, you can have them recharge their account themselves, or they can come back to you for more. This can be very beneficial for closing follow-up deals.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces such as web pages or mobile apps. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that models should be able to do on data. CRUD applications are very common in web development, as they allow users to perform basic operations on data without writing complex code.</p>
<p>CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. The database is where the data is stored and retrieved. The user interface is the front end that users interact with. The API contains the code and methods that communicate with the database. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will review some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We will also provide some examples and tips on how to use them effectively.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="database">Database<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#database" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database" title="Direct link to Database">​</a></h2>
<p>The database is the core of any CRUD application, as it stores the data that users can create, read, update, and delete. There are many types of databases available, but they can be broadly categorized into two groups: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL).</p>
<p>Relational databases use tables to store data; each table has a predefined schema and each row represents a record. Relational databases are good for structured and consistent data that requires complex queries and transactions. Some of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>
<p>Non-relational databases use collections to store data, where each collection can have a flexible schema and each document represents a record. Non-relational databases are good for unstructured and dynamic data that require high scalability and performance. Some of the most popular non-relational databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase, and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Choosing the right database for your CRUD application depends on several factors, such as the type and volume of data you need to store, the level of consistency and reliability you need to ensure, and the complexity and frequency of queries you need to perform. You should also consider the compatibility and integration of your database with your user interface and API tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="user-interface">User Interface<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#user-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Interface" title="Direct link to User Interface">​</a></h2>
<p>The user interface is the front end of your CRUD application, where users can see and manipulate the data stored in your database. The user interface can be built using various technologies and frameworks, depending on the type and complexity of your application.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, CSS styles the appearance and layout of your web page, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to your web page. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or use libraries and frameworks that simplify and enhance your development process.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular libraries and frameworks for building user interfaces are React, Angular, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, etc. These tools provide various features and benefits for creating dynamic and responsive web pages that can communicate with your API and database.</p>
<p>Another way to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using low-code or no-code platforms. These platforms allow you to create web pages using drag-and-drop components and visual editors without writing much or any code. Some of the most popular low-code or no-code platforms are Budibase, Appsmith, Bubble.io, Webflow, etc. These tools are great for beginners or non-developers who want to create simple and fast CRUD applications without learning complex technologies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="api">API<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API" title="Direct link to API">​</a></h2>
<p>The API is the bridge between your user interface and your database. It defines how your user interface can request data from your database or send data to your database using HTTP methods such as GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), or DELETE (delete). The API also handles authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, etc.</p>
<p>There are many ways to build an API for your CRUD application, but one of the most common ways is using REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is an architectural style that defines how resources (data) can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods and formats such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are easy to understand and use by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building REST APIs are Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, etc. These tools are frameworks that provide various features and libraries for creating and managing web servers and APIs.</p>
<p>Another way to build an API for your CRUD application is using GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language and a runtime that allows you to define and execute queries and mutations (operations) on your data using a single endpoint. GraphQL APIs are more flexible and efficient than REST APIs, as they allow you to request or send only the data you need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building GraphQL APIs are Apollo Server, Prisma, Hasura, Graphene, etc. These tools are libraries or platforms that help you create and manage GraphQL servers and schemas.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="tools-for-building-crud-applications">Tools For Building Crud Applications<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#tools-for-building-crud-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tools For Building Crud Applications" title="Direct link to Tools For Building Crud Applications">​</a></h2>
<p>You will find many software claiming to provide ease in building useful CRUD Applications, but you need to be careful to find the ones that help in making the most compatible CRUD Applications. Let us discuss the top 7 software that can help you. We short-listed these seven tools according to client’s preferences and feasibility. We will mention their features and drawbacks so that you can choose wisely and according to your demands.</p>

<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces. CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we reviewed some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We also provided some examples and tips on how to use them effectively. We hope this post helped you learn more about CRUD applications and how to build them.</p>

<p>The community indeed has some good reviews.</p>

<p>Github: <a href="https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illa.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illa.cloud</a></p>
<p>The main users of ILLA Cloud are backend engineers, which might be different from what most people think. A large number of backend engineers have used ILLA Cloud to build numerous data panels and management backends. After all, web development has always been a headache for backend engineers. The tools built with ILLA Cloud are indeed quite aesthetically pleasing and fast.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also supports collaboration, allowing multiple people to edit a project together. Backend engineers no longer need to worry about building various internal backends. We all know the pain and tears of relying on front-end engineers.</p>
<p>The official website also has some solutions, which currently seem to focus mainly on management backends, data panels, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI text-to-image panel</li>
<li>AI voice processing panel</li>
<li>Data analysis panel</li>
<li>Content management CMS</li>
<li>Custom CRM</li>
<li>Management backend</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/solution.png" alt="solution" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>They also support building workflows, and it seems they have done a lot of work in the low-code field, looking like a well-rounded product. It basically meets various common cases.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Daily reporting of the number of stars on GitHub</li>
<li>Daily booking of meeting rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers use ILLA Flow to automatically execute many tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading business data from a database daily and sending it to Slack</li>
<li>Building CI/CD reporting systems</li>
<li>Sending emails when certain warnings occur</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/flow.jpeg" alt="flow" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="user-experience">User Experience<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/popular-tool#user-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Experience" title="Direct link to User Experience">​</a></h2>
<p>I briefly experienced it, and they have really put a lot of effort into the editor's smoothness and overall experience. The overall editing experience is quite good. It includes smooth drag-and-drop capabilities and also supports collaboration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/team.gif" alt="collabration" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Various database integration capabilities are also supported, allowing quick data reading and writing from various data sources and databases. For backend engineers, integrating various services is indeed a nightmare. In this case, ILLA has already done the work. They also support integration with Huggingface, which seems like an official collaboration. It allows for quick use of the model capabilities on Huggingface, which is indeed interesting. You can quickly create some AI-driven tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/popular-tool/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/popular-tool#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>There are many low-code tools, but few can be practically used and implemented. ILLA seems to have been maintained for two years now, and their company is currently fully committed to this one thing. Unlike some low-code tools produced for certain purposes, they are directly addressing the needs of developers. Everyone can try it out!"</p>]]></content>

<p>ILLA Flow supports multiple trigger types, including scheduled triggers and Webhook triggers.</p>
<p>We use ILLA Flow to do lots of things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a message to Slack when a new user registers</li>
<li>Report the number of stars on GitHub every day</li>
<li>Book a meeting room every day</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Our engineers use ILLA Flow to automate many tasks, like:</p>

<p>ILLA Flow supports scheduled triggers and the use of Webhooks for triggering. As a low-code tool, ILLA also enables the construction of panels to drive multiple workflows, forming a complete business process. Currently, the product is entirely free and requires no costs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/launch-flow/dashboard.jpeg" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Our initial intention in creating this product was to address the lack of developer-friendly workflow products on the market. We aim to build a complete low-code matrix product to provide a better experience. Moreover, we have achieved multi-person real-time collaboration, similar to the experience of editing in Figma, ensuring that a team can edit workflows together.</p>
<p>As an early-stage product, there are still many features that are not perfect, and we hope everyone can provide valuable feedback to help us optimize it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I'm Owen. As a Backend Engineer, I'm not very skilled at creating Web UIs, but I often need to develop various data panels and admin backends to meet the diverse needs of my colleagues.</p>
<p>This ranges from displaying complex business data to visualizing CI/CD tasks, and even creating special admin backends for Christmas events. I can't complete these tasks alone and need to collaborate with a frontend engineer for continuous iterations. This has significantly impacted my work efficiency.</p>
<p>I hope to independently produce various tools for internal team use, as well as simple tools for personal use and some time-sensitive tools. My biggest needs are for these tools to be aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and quick to build. Therefore, I am now fully committed to a project that helps backend engineers rapidly construct customized tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-illa-cloud">What is ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/backend-create-web-ui#what-is-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>ILLA is a low-code tool designed for developers, allowing you to rapidly develop Admin Panels and Dashboards through a drag-and-drop interface. ILLA Cloud integrates with a wide range of common databases and data sources, including REST APIs and GraphQL.</p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>With ILLA, you can quickly build various tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panels</li>
<li>Data Dashboards</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be created with drag-and-drop ease, requiring only a minimal amount of JavaScript for logical connections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/backend-create-web-ui/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also features a comprehensive set of connector tools, capable of integrating AI, databases, and various SaaS platforms. This enables your clients to quickly link the products you build with the ones they use. It supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and also allows for parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/backend-create-web-ui/connector.png" alt="Connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/backend-create-web-ui/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>No one needs to build a microservice for a certain type of database anymore, where the microservice is just for executing a SQL query. ILLA supports direct SQL database queries, which is very user-friendly for backend developers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/backend-create-web-ui/sql.png" alt="SQL" class="img_CfaS"></p>

<p>In the dynamic landscape of frequent holidays and special occasions, creating distinct online experiences becomes imperative. Each company may have its unique marketing days, requiring engaging activities. Crafting these online marketing campaigns inevitably poses a development challenge, necessitating substantial resource allocation. While the need for visually captivating designs is evident, the overall complexity may not justify significant development costs, especially when the lifecycle is limited to 1-2 weeks. In such cases, opting for low-code tools emerges as a financially prudent decision. Here, we advocate for a specific low-code solution.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="addressing-user-facing-components-webflow">Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#addressing-user-facing-components-webflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow" title="Direct link to Addressing User-Facing Components: Webflow">​</a></h3>
<p>Webflow, with its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and designer-friendly adjustments, facilitates the creation of visually stunning landing pages. This approach allows users to interact with an aesthetically pleasing website, and remarkably, only requires the expertise of a single designer. Furthermore, Webflow offers an array of templates that can be easily customized, enabling the swift construction of an exquisite website.</p>

<p>Regardless of the frontend technology used, an effective management tool is indispensable for overseeing business operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILLA Cloud</a>, as an out-of-the-box low-code tool, empowers developers to rapidly construct internal tools using straightforward JavaScript, eliminating the need to create new projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panel</li>
<li>Data Dashboard</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to scenarios relying on component libraries, ILLA Cloud boasts a 10x faster construction speed for the aforementioned tools. Additionally, ILLA Cloud supports collaborative editing among multiple team members, fostering efficient teamwork.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>The synergy of these two tools expedites the creation of business requirements in marketing scenarios. This synergistic approach minimizes the need for extensive development resources while addressing the demand for quick response and deployment. Consequently, it propels the business iteration speed to new heights.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="when-initiating-a-novel-business-venture">When Initiating a Novel Business Venture<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#when-initiating-a-novel-business-venture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When Initiating a Novel Business Venture" title="Direct link to When Initiating a Novel Business Venture">​</a></h2>
<p>The commencement of a project necessitates a thorough evaluation of its characteristics. For comprehensive toC products such as social platforms, gaming applications, or IM services, the recommendation leans towards traditional development methodologies. This ensures a high degree of flexibility in adapting to evolving requirements.</p>
<p>For ventures centered around retail or services, the utilization of Shopify for frontend presentation proves advantageous. This choice guarantees widespread distribution of products while curbing development costs. Furthermore, Shopify supports customization, catering to diverse business needs effectively.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional/shopify.png" alt="shopify" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>In instances where a swift development of an app or website is paramount, direct coding may offer a faster solution. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate solution heavily relies on the unique attributes of the scenario.</p>
<p>If the backend functionality of Shopify falls short of requirements, the integration of ILLA Cloud can bridge the gap, providing a platform for customized management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>In the decision-making process for selecting development tools, a multifaceted approach is recommended. While direct coding provides unparalleled flexibility, it does come at the cost of development speed. The strategic integration of low-code tools and SaaS solutions can yield substantial gains in productivity.</p>
<p>For operations demanding flexibility and essential to the core business, traditional development methods remain the preferred choice. The agility and control afforded by traditional development methods result in products that are highly tailored to specific needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; the best choice is the one that aligns most closely with the unique requirements of the scenario at hand.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2024 has arrived, and the ecosystem of React component libraries remains highly prosperous. This article will dissect two currently popular component libraries from various perspectives, providing an objective analysis to help users make more informed choices.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-a-component-library">Why Choose a Component Library?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/mui-2024#why-choose-a-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?" title="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?">​</a></h2>
<p>In general, every company building web applications tends to select a component library. These libraries address a significant amount of repetitive work, offering readily usable components such as Select, Input, CheckBox, and more. These components, customizable through styles or pre-existing attractive styles, enable the rapid creation of beautiful websites without the need to build extensive foundational features from scratch.</p>
<p>To summarize, component libraries are typically used in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>External tools: Directly targeted at company users, usually adhering to the company's style, more aesthetically pleasing, and responsive.</li>
<li>Internal tools: Aimed at internal use by company employees, focusing on aesthetic design while prioritizing rapid functionality implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will analyze two component libraries based on the following points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Richness of Features</li>
<li>How to Choose in Different Scenarios</li>

<p>If you want to develop large projects, have high customization requirements, and wish to use high-performance data components and chart components, especially in scenarios with high business complexity and are willing to subscribe to MUI X, it is recommended to use MUI for development. Its flexible configuration and plethora of components can fully meet your requirements.</p>
<p>❌ Disadvantages</p>
<p>If you need a lightweight framework and prefer to use a CSS-only solution for layout adjustments, it is not recommended here. MUI has a comprehensive proprietary design system, comes with a certain learning curve, and Material Design's aesthetics may not suit everyone. In such cases, exploring other open-source repositories might be more suitable.</p>]]></content>

<p>⭐ GitHub Stars: 72.4k</p>
<p>💪🏼 First Release Date: Dec 22, 2014</p>
<p>nvm is an open-source project that has been maintained for nearly 10 years. Positive reviews have kept this project robust and, through continuous maintenance, it has become a perfect solution for "Node.js version management."</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="installing-nvm">Installing nvm<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/nvm-use-2024#installing-nvm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing nvm" title="Direct link to Installing nvm">​</a></h2>
<p>Since we are using a Mac for development, I strongly recommend using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> for package management and then using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a> to install nvm.</p>
<p>To install Homebrew, it is recommended to use the installation script. It requires minimal configuration and allows immediate use. Moreover, Homebrew makes it easy to uninstall repositories cleanly if needed.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Running this command will install the latest version of Homebrew, automatically handling the installation of Xcode Command Tools in the MacOS environment.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is automated. Below is an installation process example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/homebrew-install.png" alt="homebrew_install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>After a short wait, we can proceed with the installation of nvm using the installed Homebrew.</p>

<p>After confirming agreement, nvm will be completely installed. If you decide you don't want it anymore, you can use the following command to uninstall:</p>

<p>Once nvm is installed, here are some commonly used commands to help you get started. These commands should fulfill your daily needs.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm list</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "list" command displays various mainstream Node.js versions. You can install versions according to your needs, and it will also show the currently used Node.js version on your machine. It will display some codenames.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-list.png" alt="nvm_list" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>For example, "lts/gallim" is the version name for Node.js v16. To install using this codename, nvm will automatically install the latest version of v16. It's quite convenient. You can also use this command to check the currently used version.</p>
<p>Another command allows you to check the current Node.js version:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; node --version</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>After entering this command, you can verify whether the Node.js version has been successfully switched.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm install stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The second command installs a specific Node.js version; "stable" refers to a specific version number. You can also use the codename for a particular version. For example, to install "Node.js 18," you would use "nvm install 18." Here, I'm installing the "stable" version. nvm will automatically determine the latest Stable version and install it for me. After successful installation, it will automatically switch to the installed version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/stable-install.png" alt="stable-install" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Where there's an installation command, there's also an uninstallation command. Use:</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm uninstall stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>To delete the corresponding version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/nvm-use/nvm-uninstall.png" alt="nvm-uninstall" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>Once you've learned how to install and uninstall, the next important step is version switching.</p>
<div class="language-shell codeBlockContainer_USIv theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_PMfr"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_IHkF thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_THA1"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">&gt; nvm use stable</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_uxJT"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_LZ6a" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_H1v1"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_J5e4"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The "use" command allows you to quickly switch between Node.js versions currently in use. You can also use the "stable" codename. This way, you can quickly switch between versions for different projects.</p>
