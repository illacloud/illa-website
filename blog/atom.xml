        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used by many companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, and Uber. React is also used by many open-source projects, such as WordPress, Drupal, and Magento.</p>
<p>When building many interfaces, it's essential to choose an appropriate React component library. These libraries can help us quickly build user interfaces. They also provide many reusable components, such as buttons, forms, charts, tables, etc. These libraries offer many features, including themes, animations, routing, state management, and more.</p>
<p>There are many React component libraries on the market. Each library has its own features, pros and cons, and price. In this blog post, we will review the top 5 React component libraries in 2024 and compare them based on their features, ease of use, compatibility.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-choose-a-component-library">Why Choose a Component Library?<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/react-component-library#why-choose-a-component-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?" title="Direct link to Why Choose a Component Library?">​</a></h2>
<p>Typically, companies choose component libraries to build web applications to simplify repetitive tasks. Component libraries provide a range of ready-to-use components, such as dropdowns, input boxes, checkboxes, etc. These components come with customizable styles or attractive built-in styles, allowing for the rapid development of visually appealing websites without starting from scratch.</p>
<p>In summary, we usually use component libraries in two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>External tools: Directly facing company users, often consistent with the company's style, more aesthetically pleasing, and more responsive.</li>
<li>Internal tools: For internal use by company employees, emphasizing design aesthetics and rapid feature implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will analyze component libraries based on the following aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advantages</li>
<li>Disadvantages</li>
<li>How to make a choice</li>
</ol>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Web Worker is a JavaScript API that allows you to run JavaScript in the background. It is designed to run complex calculations without blocking the main thread. This is a very useful feature for web developers. However, it is not widely used. In this article, I will show you how to use Web Worker.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-web-worker">What is Web Worker<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/web-worker-tutorial#what-is-web-worker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Web Worker" title="Direct link to What is Web Worker">​</a></h2>
<p>As is well known, one of the key features of the JavaScript language is its single-threaded nature, meaning it can only synchronously process one task at a time. This is also a significant point of criticism by backend developers for the emergence of Node.js, which is derived from this language.</p>
<p>However, when JavaScript was initially designed, it was intentionally designed as a single-threaded language, primarily due to its intended use case at the time.</p>
<p>The original purpose of JavaScript was to facilitate interaction between the web page and the user, manipulating DOM or BOM elements. If multiple threads were used to pursue efficiency in this context, it would lead to issues such as resource contention and data synchronization. Therefore, it was necessary to specify that only one thread could directly manipulate page elements at any given time to ensure system stability and security.</p>
<p>Despite this, JavaScript is not limited to linear task processing. JavaScript has message queues and an event loop mechanism, allowing concurrency through asynchronous message handling. In high I/O-concurrent transaction processing, the performance is excellent because it eliminates the need to manually create and destroy threads and occupy additional thread management space. Consequently, Node.js, as an explorer of JavaScript on the server side, exhibits significant advantages in handling high-concurrency network requests.</p>
<p>Although JavaScript effectively addresses the performance issues related to high I/O with its asynchronous mechanisms, the fundamental nature of single-threaded execution remains unchanged. The drawback is evident when it comes to handling CPU-intensive tasks, as it cannot fully harness the computational resources of modern multi-core, multi-threaded machines.</p>
<p>In modern large-scale frontend projects, as code complexity increases, local compute-intensive tasks also become more demanding. Running JavaScript projects in a single thread inevitably results in the application being busy with computations and neglecting the frequent user interactions, leading to suboptimal user experiences. In more severe cases, when there are too many compute-intensive tasks, it can lead to the web page becoming unresponsive due to resource saturation. Therefore, the need for local multi-threaded computing capability in web projects became imperative, giving rise to Web Workers.</p>
<p>Web Workers were introduced as a standard in HTML5, and they are officially defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Web Workers makes it possible to run a script operation in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It allows JavaScript scripts to create multiple threads, thus fully utilizing the CPU's multi-core computing capabilities without blocking the main thread (typically referred to as the UI rendering thread).</p>
<p>Although Web Workers are part of the HTML5 standard, they were actually proposed in a draft by W3C as early as 2009. Therefore, their compatibility is excellent, and they are supported by virtually all major web browsers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/web-worker-tutorial/worker.png" alt="web_worker" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="the-limitations-of-web-workers">The Limitations of Web Workers<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/web-worker-tutorial#the-limitations-of-web-workers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Limitations of Web Workers" title="Direct link to The Limitations of Web Workers">​</a></h2>
<p>It's important to note that Web Workers fundamentally do not break JavaScript's single-threaded nature.</p>
<p>In fact, the code within a Web Worker script cannot directly manipulate DOM nodes and cannot use the majority of BOM (Browser Object Model) APIs. Its global environment is DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope rather than Window. The Worker operates in a sandbox, running entirely separate JavaScript files from the main thread.</p>
<p>These limitations imposed on Workers are designed to avoid the resource contention issues mentioned at the beginning of this article. Their primary use case is to act as adjuncts to the main thread, handling high CPU-intensive data processing tasks and then passing the execution results back to the main thread through inter-thread communication. Throughout this process, the main thread continues to be responsive to user interactions, effectively preventing page lagging issues.</p>

<p>Currently, browser support for Web Workers is quite comprehensive, and you can typically use them by simply providing the URI of the Worker script and instantiating it.</p>

<p>Based on the previous section, we have already been able to use the Worker's API to harness the browser's multi-threading capabilities quite simply. However, it lacks some usability features that are often needed in engineering applications, such as asynchronous responses. Let's do that next.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need an asynchronous callback collection called <code>actionHandlerMap</code>, which is used to store Promise resolve methods awaiting responses from the Worker. The keys can be specified using some unique identifier from the communication (ensuring uniqueness is sufficient). Next, we need to encapsulate the native <code>postMessage</code> and <code>onmessage</code> methods.</p>
<p>In the messages sent via <code>postMessage</code>, we include an <code>id</code> and place the current Promise's resolve method into <code>actionHandlerMap</code>, awaiting the Worker's response.</p>
<p>Regarding the <code>onmessage</code> listener, after receiving a response from the Worker, we match it with the corresponding Promise and execute the <code>.then()</code> method. After completion, we remove the Promise's resolve function from the collection.</p>

<p>In summary, this article provided a brief overview of Web Workers, including their capabilities and limitations, to give readers a comprehensive understanding of their use cases. It proposed a solution for encapsulating the native Worker API to enable Promise-based invocation. Finally, it recommended a feature-rich mature solution currently used within the team, with the hope of assisting frontend developers interested in working on Worker enhancements in the near future.</p>]]></content>

<p>In the TypeScript generic variable naming convention, 4 common generic variable names are defaulted. To improve readability, it is not recommended to define them as other variable names.</p>
<p>T: Represents the first parameter
K: Represents the key type of the object
V: Represents the value type of the object
E: Represents the element type</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need to constrain generic parameters, limiting each variable's type. TypeScript implements type constraints through extends.</p>
<p>Generic constraint syntax is as follows:</p>
<p>Generic name extends type
T extends Length constraints T's type to include the length property, and the type of length must be number.</p>

<p>The keyword for generic inference is <code>infer</code>, and the syntax is <code>infer Type</code>.</p>
<p>It is generally used in combination with generic conditional types. To understand this, consider a practical example:</p>
<p>If the generic parameter <code>T</code> can be assigned to the type <code>{t: infer Test}</code>, then the type is the inferred type <code>Test</code>, otherwise, the type is <code>string</code>.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IT Support is divided into Technical Support and Program Support.</p>
<p>Technical Support requires technicians with a broad knowledge structure. Companies of a certain size all have an IT department, commonly referred to as network management, but not all companies have Program Support.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="job-content-of-it-support">Job Content of IT Support<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/it-support#job-content-of-it-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Job Content of IT Support" title="Direct link to Job Content of IT Support">​</a></h2>
<p>In ordinary companies, the IT department's Technical Support is responsible for managing the company's information system, database, machinery hardware equipment, etc. If the company needs any special software or to update a new system, it is usually done by forming a team with programmers from a technology company and the company's own Program Support.</p>
<p>Technical Support is more like a consultant, guiding the more macroscopic direction, so they generally know a lot.</p>
<p>Program Support specializes more in coding.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AI development has reached a point today where it's no longer a novelty, but rather widely applied in various fields. However, for most people, AI remains a high-barrier technology, requiring a significant amount of time and effort to learn before it can be applied effectively in practical work.</p>
<p>Each of us has our own unique needs, such as building text-to-image tools or writing tools specific to our work chains. There are numerous interesting models on HuggingFace, allowing us to quickly create our own AI tools based on these models, thereby making our work more intelligent!</p>
<p>Here is a recommended tool that allows users to build AI tools like assembling blocks:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="illa-cloud">ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools#illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>The official website is: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/illacloud/illa-builder</a></p>
<p>This open-source low-code tool's slogan is: <strong>Build AI Driven Business Tools</strong>. It focuses on helping users quickly build AI-driven tools. Users can construct pages through drag-and-drop. Then, by using three major functions, they can connect to AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>ILLA AI Agent</li>
<li>Models from HuggingFace</li>
<li>RestAPI to call OpenAI's interface</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for the quick creation of personalized AI tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="building-smart-applications">Building Smart Applications<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools#building-smart-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Smart Applications" title="Direct link to Building Smart Applications">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we use OpenAI's text-to-image interface to build our own text-to-image panel, using tools built with ILLA Cloud, which offers certain advantages:</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/image-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/image-generator</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The generated images can be sent to any system or SaaS using the ILLA Flow feature.</li>
<li>The models used later can be called via RestAPI or through HuggingFace's models.</li>
<li>Built-in prompts can be added to ensure that the generated content is sufficiently customized.</li>
<li>The ILLA AI Agent feature can enrich the content's prompts, as not everyone is familiar with writing prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/image_generate_content.webp" alt="image_generate_content" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>I used several components here, quickly creating my own web panel through drag-and-drop, and then connected the logic through JavaScript, making it available for use by my team.</p>
<p>I built two examples; another is an AI voice processing panel.</p>
<p>Example here: <a href="https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com/ai-voice-generator</a></p>
<p>This panel has the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes transcription</li>
<li>Generation of meeting minutes</li>
<li>Translation and dubbing of meeting minutes</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools/mix_ai_voice.webp" alt="mix_ai_voice" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>It primarily uses OpenAI's Whisper capability. There are thousands of AI capabilities, but the most important is to find what suits you. Using ILLA Cloud, you can quickly build AI applications like building blocks. Start using it now!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/build-ai-tools#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>From the above introduction, we can see that using ILLA Cloud, you can quickly build your own AI tools, and ILLA Cloud has a rich array of components, basically meeting a large number of everyday business needs.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slack, as a primary communication tool for many people's work, has become one of the essential tools that must be opened daily.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slack, as a primary communication tool for many people's work, has become one of the essential tools that must be opened daily. Supporting powerful text and media formats, Slack allows us to send various messages. As developers, we have a multitude of tasks that need to be automated, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Compilation and Building</strong>: Automating the process of code compilation, especially in large projects, can significantly improve efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Test Execution</strong>: Automatically running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to ensure code quality.</li>
<li><strong>Code Deployment</strong>: Automating code deployment to production or test environments, a common practice in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes.</li>
<li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery</strong>: Regularly automating database and application data backups, and restoring them when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Alerts</strong>: Automating the monitoring of system and application performance and sending alerts in case of issues.</li>
<li><strong>Log File Management</strong>: Automating the collection, analysis, and archiving of logs.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Configuration</strong>: Using configuration management tools to automatically set up and maintain development, testing, and production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Generation</strong>: Automatically generating documentation from code comments or database structures.</li>
<li><strong>Batch Processing of Data or Files</strong>: Automatically performing data transformations, migrations, or other batch processing tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Management</strong>: Automatically managing project dependencies to ensure the latest and compatible versions of libraries and frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks are usually automated through various tools and scripts, such as using Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes, or Ansible, Puppet for environment configuration and management. Developers use many tools to accomplish these tasks, but these tools are usually independent. After completing their tasks, I believe everyone would appreciate a comprehensive notification for updates.</p>
<p>Studies show that if an issue is notified via Slack at the time of creation, the resolution time can be reduced by 50%. Therefore, we need a tool to help us automate message sending to Slack, allowing us to see all messages in one place, rather than checking various tools.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="how-to-solve">How to Solve<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack#how-to-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Solve" title="Direct link to How to Solve">​</a></h2>
<p>Here we choose a tool to solve this, named ILLA Flow. It is a connector tool aimed at developers, helping them quickly build various automation tasks, including automating message sending to Slack.</p>
<p>ILLA Flow offers various integrations, including but not limited to the most commonly used RestAPI, GraphQL, and a vast number of database connections and various SaaS platform capabilities, allowing you to quickly connect your products with those used by your customers. ILLA Flow also supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/resource.png" alt="resource" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>The most unique feature of ILLA Flow is the ability to incorporate an AI Agent into the workflow. This allows you to use an AI Agent, created by OpenAI's model, to process your notifications before sending them, making the notifications smarter and more interesting. You can also use the AI Agent for complex analyses, simplifying previously challenging summaries.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/agent.png" alt="agent" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="achieved-results">Achieved Results<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack#achieved-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Achieved Results" title="Direct link to Achieved Results">​</a></h2>
<p>We can create a workflow in ILLA Flow and then call Slack's Webhook in the workflow to achieve automated message sending to Slack.</p>
<p>After the completion of CI/CD tools, or after daily scheduled tasks, we can see messages in Slack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>We can also connect ILLA Flow to GitHub, allowing us to see messages sent by ILLA Flow in GitHub Issues.</p>
<p>We can also connect ILLA Flow to the alert monitoring system, so when an alarm or anomaly occurs, we can see messages in Slack.</p>
<p>Finally, another product of ILLA, ILLA Builder, supports building custom panels, allowing us to jump directly to ILLA Builder to view more information through the links sent in Slack, making notifications very smart and detailed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/automate-send-to-slack#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>In daily work, there are numerous automation scenarios, and ILLA Flow is a tool aimed at developers. Most other automation connection tools are geared towards general users, which can make configuration more complex for developers.</p>
<p>Using ILLA Flow, you can integrate AI Agents and various SaaS with one click, making internal team processes more automated and notifications smarter.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Owen, a full-stack engineer with previous experience at TikTok. My role there involved developing the platform, known for its engaging short video content, and ensuring a delightful user experience.</p>
<p>I am currently a freelancer and once took on a web development project on a freelancer platform. The frontend part of this project didn't take much of my time, but the extensive requirements for Admin Panels consumed a lot of it.</p>
<p>All my data was stored on Supabase, and I developed a complete set of REST APIs for backend management. I realized that most of the work involved CRUD operations on Supabase. I needed a tool to help me quickly develop these Admin Panels.</p>
<p>So, I created an open-source project to assist in the rapid development of Admin Panels. This project is named ILLA Cloud.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="what-is-illa-cloud">What is ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer#what-is-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to What is ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>ILLA is a low-code tool designed for developers, allowing you to rapidly develop Admin Panels and Dashboards through a drag-and-drop interface. ILLA Cloud integrates with a wide range of common databases and data sources, including REST APIs and GraphQL.</p>
<p>Official Website: <a href="https://illacloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://illacloud.com</a></p>
<p>With ILLA, you can quickly build various tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web &amp; App Admin Panels</li>
<li>Data Dashboards</li>
<li>Customized B2B Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be created with drag-and-drop ease, requiring only a minimal amount of JavaScript for logical connections.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<p>ILLA also features a comprehensive set of connector tools, capable of integrating AI, databases, and various SaaS platforms. This enables your clients to quickly link the products you build with the ones they use. It supports scheduled tasks, Webhooks, and also allows for parameter passing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.illacloud.com/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer/connector.png" alt="connector" class="img_CfaS"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-created-illa-cloud">Why I created ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-created-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I created ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>For freelancers, the most important thing is undoubtedly time, as time is money. I don't want to spend too much time on Admin Panels; I need a tool that helps me develop Admin Panels quickly. Additionally, for my clients, usability and aesthetic appeal are paramount. Therefore, using a low-code tool for development offers a very user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>With drag-and-drop, I can rapidly construct an Admin Panel that directly interacts with Supabase, without needing to write any code. This tool helps me quickly develop Admin Panels, allowing me to focus on developing business logic.</p>
<p>The reason I use Supabase is that it's an extremely user-friendly open-source project, which aids in swiftly setting up backend services. Moreover, its documentation is very accessible, making it easy for me to get started.</p>
<p>ILLA Cloud has an integration with Supabase. With SQL, I can quickly query and modify data in Supabase, facilitating rapid development of both Dashboards and Admin Panels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="why-i-recommend-illa-cloud">Why I recommend ILLA Cloud<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/boost-freelancer#why-i-recommend-illa-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud" title="Direct link to Why I recommend ILLA Cloud">​</a></h2>
<p>You only need to pay $20 per month for ILLA, and this fee is solely for the use of ILLA's editor, which is very freelancer-friendly. You might need to interact with numerous clients, but you don't have to pay for the users; you only pay for yourself.</p>
<p>Additionally, ILLA comes with a ready-to-use Drive service. For file storage needs during development, you can directly use the Drive service, which aids in rapid development. Moreover, if your client has a high usage volume, you can have them recharge their account themselves, or they can come back to you for more. This can be very beneficial for closing follow-up deals.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces such as web pages or mobile apps.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CRUD applications are a type of software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using various interfaces such as web pages or mobile apps. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that models should be able to do on data. CRUD applications are very common in web development, as they allow users to perform basic operations on data without writing complex code.</p>
<p>CRUD applications consist of three main components: a database, a user interface, and an API. The database is where the data is stored and retrieved. The user interface is the front end that users interact with. The API contains the code and methods that communicate with the database. Each component can use different technologies and frameworks, depending on the needs and preferences of the developer.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will review some of the best tools for building CRUD applications, covering each component separately. We will also provide some examples and tips on how to use them effectively.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="database">Database<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#database" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database" title="Direct link to Database">​</a></h2>
<p>The database is the core of any CRUD application, as it stores the data that users can create, read, update, and delete. There are many types of databases available, but they can be broadly categorized into two groups: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL).</p>
<p>Relational databases use tables to store data; each table has a predefined schema and each row represents a record. Relational databases are good for structured and consistent data that requires complex queries and transactions. Some of the most popular relational databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.</p>
<p>Non-relational databases use collections to store data, where each collection can have a flexible schema and each document represents a record. Non-relational databases are good for unstructured and dynamic data that require high scalability and performance. Some of the most popular non-relational databases are MongoDB, CouchDB, Firebase, and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Choosing the right database for your CRUD application depends on several factors, such as the type and volume of data you need to store, the level of consistency and reliability you need to ensure, and the complexity and frequency of queries you need to perform. You should also consider the compatibility and integration of your database with your user interface and API tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="user-interface">User Interface<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#user-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Interface" title="Direct link to User Interface">​</a></h2>
<p>The user interface is the front end of your CRUD application, where users can see and manipulate the data stored in your database. The user interface can be built using various technologies and frameworks, depending on the type and complexity of your application.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, CSS styles the appearance and layout of your web page, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to your web page. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or use libraries and frameworks that simplify and enhance your development process.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular libraries and frameworks for building user interfaces are React, Angular, Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, jQuery, etc. These tools provide various features and benefits for creating dynamic and responsive web pages that can communicate with your API and database.</p>
<p>Another way to build a user interface for a CRUD application is by using low-code or no-code platforms. These platforms allow you to create web pages using drag-and-drop components and visual editors without writing much or any code. Some of the most popular low-code or no-code platforms are Budibase, Appsmith, Bubble.io, Webflow, etc. These tools are great for beginners or non-developers who want to create simple and fast CRUD applications without learning complex technologies.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="api">API<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/the-best-tools-for-build-crud-applications#api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to API" title="Direct link to API">​</a></h2>
<p>The API is the bridge between your user interface and your database. It defines how your user interface can request data from your database or send data to your database using HTTP methods such as GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), or DELETE (delete). The API also handles authentication, authorization, validation, error handling, etc.</p>
<p>There are many ways to build an API for your CRUD application, but one of the most common ways is using REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is an architectural style that defines how resources (data) can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP methods and formats such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are easy to understand and use by both humans and machines.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building REST APIs are Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, etc. These tools are frameworks that provide various features and libraries for creating and managing web servers and APIs.</p>
<p>Another way to build an API for your CRUD application is using GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language and a runtime that allows you to define and execute queries and mutations (operations) on your data using a single endpoint. GraphQL APIs are more flexible and efficient than REST APIs, as they allow you to request or send only the data you need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular tools for building GraphQL APIs are Apollo Server, Prisma, Hasura, Graphene, etc. These tools are libraries or platforms that help you create and manage GraphQL servers and schemas.</p>

<p>The commencement of a project necessitates a thorough evaluation of its characteristics. For comprehensive toC products such as social platforms, gaming applications, or IM services, the recommendation leans towards traditional development methodologies. This ensures a high degree of flexibility in adapting to evolving requirements.</p>
<p>For ventures centered around retail or services, the utilization of Shopify for frontend presentation proves advantageous. This choice guarantees widespread distribution of products while curbing development costs. Furthermore, Shopify supports customization, catering to diverse business needs effectively.</p>

<p>In instances where a swift development of an app or website is paramount, direct coding may offer a faster solution. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate solution heavily relies on the unique attributes of the scenario.</p>
<p>If the backend functionality of Shopify falls short of requirements, the integration of ILLA Cloud can bridge the gap, providing a platform for customized management.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_dXVO" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://illacloud.github.io/illa-website/blog/lowcode-vs-traditional#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>In the decision-making process for selecting development tools, a multifaceted approach is recommended. While direct coding provides unparalleled flexibility, it does come at the cost of development speed. The strategic integration of low-code tools and SaaS solutions can yield substantial gains in productivity.</p>
<p>For operations demanding flexibility and essential to the core business, traditional development methods remain the preferred choice. The agility and control afforded by traditional development methods result in products that are highly tailored to specific needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution; the best choice is the one that aligns most closely with the unique requirements of the scenario at hand.</p>]]></content>
