2024 has arrived, and the development of low-code tools remains vibrant. Many companies are utilizing low-code tools to enhance development efficiency. This article will analyze popular low-code tools from various perspectives, aiding readers in making informed choices.

## Why Choose Low-Code Tools?

The emergence of low-code tools primarily addresses the issue of low development efficiency. These tools assist developers in rapidly constructing complete projects without starting from scratch, significantly boosting development efficiency. Development using low-code tools requires no coding; instead, developers can drag and drop components to build pages. This allows developers to focus more on implementing business logic without concerning themselves with page construction. Moreover, there is no need for any maintenance work; deploying the code to a server is sufficient, allowing developers to concentrate on business logic implementation.

## Why Choose Open Source?

As a development tool, open-source low-code tools offer several advantages:

- Editable for customization
- Deployable independently
- Community collaboration for faster issue resolution
- Abundant community template resources

Choosing an open-source low-code tool can make our work twice as efficient. Open-source low-code tools are not just tools but ecosystems. We believe open source can make software more powerful, flexible, and reliable.
