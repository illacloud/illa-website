Hello everyone, I'm Owen, a full-stack engineer with previous experience at TikTok. My role there involved developing the platform, known for its engaging short video content, and ensuring a delightful user experience.

Despite my background as a Backend Engineer, I frequently found myself immersed in creating numerous data dashboards and admin panels to cater to my colleagues' diverse needs. From showcasing multifaceted business data to visualizing CI/CD tasks and crafting a special Admin Panel for a Christmas event, I managed to accomplish all these in just 14 days.

This barrage of disparate UI-related tasks presented significant challenges in my daily workflow. Ultimately, this led to my resignation. But, this experience inspired me to devote myself entirely to a new venture: assisting server engineers of various programming backgrounds to efficiently build the tools I mentioned earlier.

Check out the project:

ILLA is an innovative open-source, low-code tool that I've both developed and used. It empowers you to effortlessly create websites using a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Within minutes, you can assemble a stunning dashboard or admin panel. It's a myth that server engineers can't craft UIs – with ILLA, you no longer have to depend on others to quickly develop visually appealing UIs.

Moreover, ILLA seamlessly integrates with RestAPI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other leading databases, allowing for straightforward CRUD operations without the need to develop a microservice for simple data manipulation.

Thanks to ILLA, I can now rapidly provide my colleagues with the desired data dashboards. Whether it's swiftly assembling a dashboard for a unique event or devising an engaging task assignment system for interns, it's all simplified.

I encourage you to try it out. Join me in becoming a more content and efficient engineer.
